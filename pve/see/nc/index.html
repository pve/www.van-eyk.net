<h1>Nature meets Culture</h1>

<p>In Europe, which is where I live, there is hardly a place to
find where the land is not shaped by humans. Maybe that is the
reason why I am fascinated with the border between nature and
culture. There are still a few places where these borders exist.
On these pages I have documented a few. Click on a picture to
enlarge it. After these images continue to <a
