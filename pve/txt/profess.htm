<h1>Professional History</h1>

<p>Mostly I work on projects that help organizations communicate
with computers. A number of lessons learned in these projects are<a
href="sci-pub.htm"> written up in articles.</a></p>

<p>Recently I have worked for Deloitte &amp; Touche, after the
merger with my previous employer, Bakkenist.</p>

<p>In 1997 I worked as technical director at EUnet, an Internet provider, which
is now part of Qwest.</p>

<p>From 1992 to 1997 I worked at CVI (Dutch Rail Automation),
which was later taken over by <a href="http://www.eds.com">EDS</a>.
Projects there included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Design of a client-server architecture, including
        associated dedicated protocols </li>
    <li>Project management of an EDI project for the exchange of
        consignment notes between railways </li>
    <li>Development and project management of an Internet access
        pilot. </li>
    <li>Specification of a <a href="http://www.data-mobile.com">mobile
        datacommunications</a> protocol subset </li>
    <li>Verification of a train databus using <a
        http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html">SPIN and PROMELA</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In 1995 I worked part-time at <a href="http://www.phil.uu.nl/">Utrecht
University</a> doing research on tools for <a
href="http://vl.fmnet.info/">formal
methods</a>. </p>

<p>From 1984 until 1991 I worked at the University of Twente, <a
href="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/">TIOS department</a>,
doing research on tools for LOTOS (see <a
href="http://wwwtios.cs.utwente.nl/lotos/">@UT </a>, <a
href="ftp://ftp.dit.upm.es:/pub/lotos/">@UPM </a>), and teaching
in tools and protocol implementation. In that period I spent some
time at <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a>
as it was called at the time.</p>

<p>My Masters in Computer Science was done at the <a
href="http://www.cs.rug.nl">University of Groningen</a>, so I am
on the <a href="http://www.cs.rug.nl/info/alumni.html">alumni
list</a>. </p>
