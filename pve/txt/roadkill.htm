</h2>

<p>Information processing has become the magic word for a number
of sciences that in one way or another have the human as their
subject of enquiry (in this paper I will abbreviate the stem of
information processing and similar words to ip, in this case
iping). With this, the concept of iping has acquired the status
of scientific paradigm. It becomes interesting therefore to
investigate the tools that are in use to understand iping. In
this essay I will attempt to contrast Dennett's tools <a
href="roadkill.htm#dennett78">[Dennett 78]</a>, which have a
psychological and philosophical background, with my ideas, which
have their background in the core computer science curriculum.
One can also say that I try to rephrase a part of Dennett's ideas
into my own words. <a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h2"></a> </p>

<h2 align="center"><a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h2">Dennett's
tools</a> </h2>

<p>Dennett introduces the concept of intentional system. With
that he hopes to have a good starting point for philosophical
excursions. The behaviour of intentional systems can be described
in terms of a set of &quot;beliefs&quot; and &quot;desires&quot;.
This set, the so-called beliefsystem, then forms a description of
the system at the intentional level (stance). Dennett emphasizes
that this description is relative to the describer and his goals.
In addition to the intentional level Dennett distinguishes the
design level and the physical level. A description at the design
level is in terms of the functions of the components of the
system, while a description at the physical level only uses the
physical properties of (the realisations of) these components. It
will be clear that at these latter two levels the descriptions
will become much more complex. </p>

<p>Dennett claims that an attribution of intentionality
corresponds to an attribution of rationality. Because of this,
the concept of intentionality can be used to show where a theory
of rational human thinking is using homunculi (little humans in
the human), namely there where the theory uses intentional terms
for description. </p>

<p>Belief systems can be seen as a kind of world models, they
contain information about the environment: facts, dependencies,
etc. We can therefore consider the intentional level as a kind of
meaning level. Through the use of belief systems the system
assigns a certain meaning to specific events, for example whether
these events should be avoided (are dangerous). <a
href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h3"></a> </p>

<h2 align="center"><a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h3">My Tools</a>
</h2>

<p>Software is a collective name for descriptions of ipers, in
particular those that can be realised by automata (or machines).
Computer science studies, amongst others, the construction of
software. </p>

<p>Continually recurring concepts in computer science are
&quot;representation&quot; and &quot;structuring&quot;. Input,
output, and state of an iper all have their own internal
representation. Important elements of a representation are
codings (for example red=1), where meanings are mapped to
numbers, and structurings (the way of decomposing such
representations). A good structuring makes it possible to study a
representation at several levels, and to abstract from codings.
This explains the importance of the terms hierarchy and level: a
hierarchy is a structuring that is divisible in levels. Besides
these, we have the concept of interpretation. This encompasses
the concept decoding. </p>

<p>So: a coding maps meanings to numbers (or bits), a
representation maps meanings to meanings, and an interpretation
maps numbers to meanings. </p>

<p>Most computer programs convert information in one
representation into another representation. If these
representations are not adequate, this process will usually
involve a search process. If, for example, a quadratic equation
is represented in polynomial form, its zeros can be computed,
whereas with a representation in functional form they need to
actually be searched for with some kind of approximation method.
This conversion adds nothing to the amount of meaning: in a
closed ipsystem, the total amount of information can only
decrease. Stated differently, the input plus the computerprogram
are a redundant description of the output. A classic example of
information reduction is in so-called management information
systems, where megabytes of data on the ups and downs of the
enterprise are condensed into a few well-organized tables and
graphs on which decisions are based. </p>

<p>This leads us to the conformity principle. It is a fact of
experience that the structure of an iper is related to (is in
conformity with) its environment. The iper models in a certain
sense reality, its environment. This modelling is naturally
relative with respect to the goals because, in general, it will
be imperfect. Illustrations and applications of this principle: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Design methodologically: if a structuring of the
        environment is given or obvious, derive the structure of
        the iper from that. A compiler for programming languages
        will in its structure correspond to the grammar for that
        language. </li>
    <li>Explanatory: it is not surprising that an iper becomes
        more difficult as the mismatch between the structure of
        its input and the structure of its output becomes bigger.
        In that respect the structuring of the iper can be seen
        as a kind of least common denominator of the structures
        of the input and the output. </li>
    <li>The argument of the structured programming movement: or,
        how can we, given our limited capacities (abilities),
        most easily construct ipers <a
        href="roadkill.htm#dijkstra72">[Dijkstra 72]</a>. The
        cognitive human is characterized by a limitation in the
        ability to do a lot at the same time. This handicap is
        partly compensated by the use of a number of techniques
        to control complexity. Dijkstra calls these enumeration,
        mathematical induction and abstraction. According to the
        conformity principle these have there counterpart in the
        programming language constructs sequencing, alternation,
        repetition, and subroutines. If we want to be able to
        comprehend a computer program of some size, then it may
        be build with only the aforementioned programming
        language constructs. </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center"><a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h4">How does
man see the world?</a> </h2>

<p>As Dennett already states in chapters 1 and 12, a lot of
computer programs of the more complex kind lend themselves to an
approach on the intentional level. In my practice, the clearest
examples of these are compilers and operating systems. In using
these naturally a lot of errors are made when the knowledge of
the user is insufficient. The typical scheme of an explanation
that puts the ignorant back on the right track is then:
&quot;Yes, but if you do this the computer then thinks that you
mean that, and since it tries to accomplish such it reacts
so.&quot; One therefore acts as if the computer assigns meaning
to our conduct, like we assign meaning to the conduct of other
people. Dijkstra calls this antropomorphizing and opposes it. I
call it intentionalising and see it as an attempt to understand
something with the tools that are natural to humans. </p>

<p>This tendency to assign meanings to events is a human quality.
Apart from the intentionalising as mentioned before it appears as
a characteristic of religions. Some examples of these are seeing </p>

<ul>
    <li>a solar eclipse as a bad spirit that eats the sun, </li>
    <li>a thunderstorm as a manifestation of Wodan driving his
        cart across the heaven, </li>
    <li>severe mischief happening to somebody as a punishment by
        God. </li>
</ul>

<p>In this context, sociologists talk about a &quot;social and
religious definition of reality&quot;. </p>

<p>For me the ultimate religion is the Zen doctrine, especially
because it questions this structuring of reality. The opening
quote of this paper is explained in <a href="roadkill.htm#kopp72">[Kopp
72]</a>, in which the search of psychotherapeutic patients for
meaning is illustrated with examples from the world literature: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The Zen master warns: &quot;If you meet the Buddha on the
    road, kill him!&quot; This admonition points up that no
    meaning that comes from outside of ourselves is real. The
    Buddhahood of each of us has already been obtained. We need
    only recognize it. Philosophy, religion, patriotism, all are
    empty idols. The only meaning in our lives is what we each
    bring to them. Killing the Buddha on the road means
    destroying the hope that anything outside ourselves can be
    our master.' (page 188) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stated differently: when it appears that something or somebody
starts to bring meaning into your life, you should put an end to
that really quick. </p>

<p>The structuring of the world in terms of meaning has,
according to the conformity principle, its counterpart in the
structure of human thought. For this Newell and Simon have
introduced the &quot;physical symbol system hypothesis&quot; <a
href="roadkill.htm#newellsimon76">[Newell Simon 76]</a> <a
href="roadkill.htm#simon81">[Simon 81]</a>, and what is a symbol
besides being a carrier of meaning? This hypothesis states that
symbol systems are necessary and sufficient for intelligence in
general. According to Simon a computer is also a symbol system,
but by now it should be clear that according to me this is more a
property of humans than of computers. <a href="roadkill.htm#top"
name="h5"></a> </p>

<h2 align="center"><a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h5">A
Hofstadter-ian strange loop</a> </h2>

<p>How arises this structuring of human thinking (by humans)? The
conclusion thrusts itself upon us via the conformity principle:
our vision on our structure is a result of that structure. Stated
differently: the fact that we think that we think in terms of
meaning is caused by the fact that we think in terms of meaning.
Apparently this self-involvedness is fundamental in psychology.
At least, that is what I have heard about <a
href="roadkill.htm#linschoten64">[Linschoten 64]</a>. <a
href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h6"></a> </p>

<h2 align="center"><a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="h6">Conclusion</a>
</h2>

<p>The concept of meaning is the most fundamental human tool. As
derivatives of that operate the concepts of information and
information processing. That is because information is created by
the favour of attaching meaning to certain patterns, physical or
otherwise. One question then remains: how is it that we get these
patterns? <a href="roadkill.htm#top" name="refs"></a> </p>
