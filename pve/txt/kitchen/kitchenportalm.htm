<p>The picture shows my
&quot;Kitchen Portal&quot;, which is an experiment in home computing. It is
basically a laptop hung on the kitchen wall, and it is used for a variety of
applications. </p>

<p>In practice the most used
applications are: showing the time, playing music and general web surfing,
roughly in that order. The time is displayed with a screensaver, synchronised
over the Internet to one of my ADSL providers' NTP servers. Playing music turns
out to be a fairly popular application. Most popular are local stations and
copies of CDs that are stored on the home file server in the attic (which runs
FreeBSD, by the way). Not all Internet radio stations stream reliably though,
but a fair amount do, and this quality does not really correlate with distance.
Web applications in rough order of popularity are: weather information and
news, traffic conditions, and various recipe sites and other cooking and diet
related information. Home grocery shopping has not turned out yet to be a
popular application, possibly because the website of the service is too
demanding of the hardware. Equally, video runs at 2 frames per second and is
practically useless. A terminal emulator gives access to the FreeBSD server,
and used to keep an eye on lengthy software recompilations. </p>

<p>The experiment grew out of
an analysis of interesting places to put computers in the home. The rather
obvious places are home-office desks, and entertainment locations, such as the
living room. Breaking away from these approaches, I tried to apply my
professional expertise, and looked at the places in the home where there is an
relative intense information and logistic interaction with the outside world. I
found it in the kitchen. The kitchen is the place where the rush hour in the
home plays out, and you can use all the information you can get to make it run
smoothly. </p>

<p>Ergonomically, the current
setup is not very ideal. The screen is at a level where most people can
comfortably watch it, but the keyboard is too high for extended usage. Even
less comfortable is the touchpad, possibly for the same reason. With current
windows systems a pointing device is essential, and it would be interesting to
experiment with either touch screens, or track balls. In practice the shortcut
keys on the top left of the keyboard are used very regularly, and it would be
good to have a dozen or so of them. The stereo sound system of this particular
model is fairly good. Its quality compares favourably to that of a portable
radio. Given the signal to noise ratio that is typical of this environment more
quality is a luxury. Higher volume would be nice at times. </p>

<p>For the experiment, the
machine is hung of the wall by a piece of string. In order to stabilize the
keyboard at an ergonomically convenient angle, a cardboard structure is hung
behind it, suspended by its own piece of string. The cardboard is folded in a
way to enhance its rigidity. An earlier version proved to be too loose. </p>

<p>The laptop is a Pentium 166
MHz, with 48 byte of memory, and a 600 by 800 pixel screen. This is really
borderline in terms of performance. The operating system is Windows 98, because
that is the most stable Windows version that can still run at some level of usefulness
on this hardware. The application takes surprisingly little software. The most
important items are: Internet Explorer 6, Media player version 9, the terminal
emulator 'putty', the screen saver, and the networking stuff. It would be
conceivable to run a non MS OS, if the appropriate media player for the typical
audio web content is available. Some active desktop components run an
additional clock and display the latest weather report. Networking is done by
WiFi, mainly because of the complications of wiring the kitchen, which lies at
the perimeter of the house. Its performance is adequate, although it appears to
suffer from some interference by the microwave oven, occasionally. Most of the
services used are based on the Internet. The only exception is the audio server
(a Pentium 60 running FreeBSD) which is provided in-house. This is because
there is currently no service on the Internet that will serve the albums that I
own for free. There does not appear to be a reasonable service that requires
more than the 1 Mbit/sec downstream speed that my current provider offers. The
only exception would be a high quality video stream, but functionally there is
little need for that in the kitchen. </p>

<p>Based on these experiences
the ideal computer environment in the kitchen would consist of a flatscreen
mounted at eye level, and a keyboard that is mounted much lower. This would resemble
a kiosk setup. Further research in pointing devices is necessary. The touchpad
is not very accurate for small movements. An additional peripheral device could
be a barcode scanner, for online grocery shopping or product information
purposes. There are no applications available for this yet, however. The sound
system could be a little better, and connected to more powerful speakers. There
might also be an application for a webcam. Application opportunities are:
streamlining grocery shopping by allowing to store partial orders and scanning
barcodes, personalised recipe databases where you can store your own recipes,
including resizing these recipes. Additionally an on-line calendar with family,
school and household events would be appropriate, but it should be linked in
some way to the agenda's of individual family members. One could also imagine a
personalised and dedicated web page that acts as a &quot;kitchen portal&quot;
in the software sense. Most of the elements it should contain have been
outlined above already. </p>

<p>A final note on innovation
and technology, you can study these things without state of the art hardware. This
hardware is currently (early 2004) years past its regular availability on the
market. It is not even current on the second hand market. Even the WiFi
equipment was purchased out of surplus stock years ago, when its manufacturer
(No Wires Needed) merged with a competitor. Apparently, when it comes to taking
advantage of modern technology, process adaptations lag severely behind
technology. This is true particular for applications that optimise interaction
with external parties. Apparently hardware innovation has outstripped demand
for it. </p>
