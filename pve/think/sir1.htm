<h2>An Apology and Manifesto </h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/index.htm">Peter van Eijk</a>, Jan 1997. </p>

<p>Software is exploding, and is surrounding us in every step we
take. From Compact Discs to televisions to the bills that you get
in the mail to the grocery store and the pizza delivery company,
everything is getting equipped with more and more software under
the hood. Whatever used to be done with pencil and paper or
simple hardware is becoming software intensive. Recently I
noticed a maintenance person plugging a laptop computer into the
room control panel of the air-conditioning system. A few years
ago people joked about bread toasters with an Internet address.
Now that joke is turning on us, it is actually becoming a
reality. </p>

<p>Media watchers talk about these phenomena as the result of <em>becoming
digital</em>, (<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">www.media.mit.edu</a>)
but to me that is only half the story. It is not just the
cramming of everything into digital bits, it is about what you
can then <em>do</em> with those bits. Once things become
digitized, they can be manipulated much more easily. Your grocery
bill used to turn into an amount to pay. It is now becoming the
input for a logistic system: you have just bought a box of soap?
A new one is about to be ordered automatically from the factory,
possibly within minutes. You are also being watched: if you buy a
six-pack of beer, what would you be likely to also buy? They
know. </p>

<p>The concept <em>being digital</em> is better replaced by the
concept <em>being software</em>. I lack a better grammatical
variant of this. It is possible to talk about mechanization and
digitization, but 'softwarisation' sounds awkward. Maybe it is
characteristic of new paradigms to not yet have words to describe
them properly. </p>

<p>Software has also become a thinking model, or metaphor. For
example, we might see our brain as a computer executing programs
(see also <a href="http://www.nlp.com/nlp/index.html">neuro
linguistic programming</a>), or society as a network of
processors. I subscribe to a lot of these ideas, though I remain
critical. That is why, in this series of columns, I want to
explore the power of the <i>software concept</i>, how it can be a
basis for understanding and work. </p>

<p>At the same time I also want to explore the boundaries of this
concept. What is fundamentally possible with this stuff and what
not? What will remain truly human? People dream of what can be
automated, such as <a href="http://www.firefly.com/">smart agents</a>
that gently guide us through cyberspace. Is this dream a
fata-morgana, or will it be tomorrows staple? My understanding of
the software paradigm is such that it even appears capable of
explaining that certain things cannot be explained. </p>

<p>In a quest for answers and illumination I have been lining my
professional history for 20 years with a study of computer
technology, philosophy, and psychology. That is the basis of what
I perceive to be a series of columns, each of which explores a
new angle of a <a href="software.htm">definition of software</a>.
</p>

<p>So, carry on exploring, let me know what you think (<a
href="mailto:pve@mindless-dot-com">by email</a>), and forgive me
for my one-sided views. I cannot do otherwise. </p>
