<h2>Evolution and Meaning </h2>

<p>How does software evolve? This is just one of the questions
that went through my mind as I finished reading <i>The Blind
Watchmaker</i>, by Richard Dawkins. It is a book about Darwin´s
theory of evolution, and goes to some length in explaining the
mechanics of biological evolution, and some of the ways in which
these mechanics present themselves in reality. As any author
after <a
href="http://www.psych.indiana.edu/cogsci/hofstadter.html">Douglas
Hofstadter</a> must do when explaining biological evolution,
Dawkins draws upon the computer for metaphors to explain a number
of essential concepts in Darwin´s theory. These metaphors
interest me because they are manifestations of my software
concepts, and as such may reveal new relations between these
concepts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common and fundamental of computer metaphors
in biology is that of a DNA strand as a written floppy disk,
containing a program to execute. A DNA strand similarly conceals
a list of instructions. In the case of DNA they are instructions
to create a living thing that is able to exploit its environment.
In reproducing, the living being communicates its essential
makeup through its DNA. In fact, Dawkins argues in a number of
books that this reasoning can be turned around, and that it is
actually the DNA that reproduces and just uses the bodies of
living beings as a way to spread its message (<em>the selfish
meme</em>). And as it is an executable message, I would call it <a
href="software.htm">software</a>. </p>

<p>Now this in itself does not explain the <i>evolution</i> of
species. This evolution happens as the DNA messages are
multiplied, mutated, recombined, and selected from. In particular
the selection process is what steers biological evolution, and
which makes that a range of species exist that are all adapted to
the environment in their own unique way. This is the proverbial <i>survival
of the fittest</i>, i.e. best adapted to the environment. Now
what does it mean to be <em>adapted</em> to the environment, and
how does the process of adaptation work? Dawkins makes some
interesting points about this. </p>

<p>The environment of each creature contains creatures of other
species as well. To be adapted to an environment means to be able
to exploit the resources provided by that environment. Now this
may or may not be a zero-sum game with the other creatures. A <i>predator-prey</i>
relationship, for example, is not usually a very beneficial one
for the prey to enter into. In a <em>symbiotic</em> relation, on
the other hand, both parties win.</p>

<p>Why do species evolve? As they adapt to their environment,
they will change with a changing environment. Dawkins makes a
strong point here that the environment contains <i>other</i>
evolving species as well, and that this leads to some powerful
mechanisms for accelerated evolution. The various species
influence each others evolution. The predator-prey relationship
is one of the theatres of an <b>arms race</b>. As the lions
evolve to become faster, the wildebeest will have to evolve too.
If they don´t, they will be driven into extinction. But as the
wildebeest become faster, the lions too have got to keep up. Lots
of biological resources are wasted in just being able to keep up
with other creatures that you race against. As in a military arms
race, would´t it be more efficient if a stop was put to it? </p>

<p>A successful species thus not only has to be adapted to the
environment, it also has to be adapted to adapting to the
environment. For every change in the environment, the species has
to be able to quickly generate new successful variations of its
DNA. It appears that sexual reproduction is a way to generate
combinations of genes faster than with an asexual way of
reproducing. Sex is a way to win an arms race, to out-evolve your
adversaries. </p>

<p>A business, as a legal entity participating in economic
transactions, also assumes an environment that can be exploited.
The environment is exploited by conducting transactions with it.
The way it does this is oftentimes described by a <em>business-plan.
</em>If our metaphors carry over, the business plan is like the
DNA of the company. It describes the make-up of the company and
thus defines what the company can do and not do in interaction
with its environment. It also follows that businesses should
therefore do well to manage their capacity for adapting to a
changing environment. </p>

(It would also be possible to investigate what the environment is that a computer program exploits, and to what extend it is involved in an arms race). A successful computer program seduces a user to spend CPU cycles on it. "

<p>The boundary between the creature and the environment, which
defines the way in which the creature exploits its environment is
also its definition of meaning. The creature's sole purpose in
life is to exploit the environment in order to stay alive and
proliferate. Each interaction it has with the environment is only
meaningful in that context (See also:<em> </em><a
href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/roadkill.htm"><em>How human is meaning</em></a>). As a
matter of fact, if the creature can think, it will create a
perception of environment that allows it to thrive. Briefly
stated, that perception of the environment is <em>its reality. </em></p>
