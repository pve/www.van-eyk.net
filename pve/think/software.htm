bot="ImageMap" i-checksum="50185" endspan --> As you can see in
the picture, <em>software</em> is the core concept in my
thinking. In the next paragraphs I'll explain how that links up a
number of other important concepts. This is part of a series
called <a href="sirframe.htm" target="_top">Software in Reality</a>.</p>

<p><a name="software"><!-- --></a>Software is a message between <a
name="people"><em>people</em></a>, to communicate. What is on a
musical record or broadcast on television is oftentimes called
software. It is intangible, yet it has a measurable effect on the
people receiving the message. There is a similarity that goes
beyond the metaphor with the software that is processed by
computers. Computer software is intangible, yet it produces a
measurable change of state in the machine. All software is
expressed in some language. This could be a verbal language, but
also a pictorial language. Understanding language in general, and
the particular language used is key to understanding software. </p>

<p>Software is the carrier of <a name="meaning"><em>meaning</em></a>.
Through the symbols that make up a language, a new meaning is
communicated. Seen from another angle, software modifies meaning.
In human communication you may think something at some time, and
attach a certain meaning to your situation. After processing a
message, the meaning you attach to your situation may very well
be different. So, the message is the meaning, and if the medium
is the message (McLuhan), then the medium has in itself meaning.

Meaning?</i></a> </p>

<p>Software is what<a name="computers"> <em>computers</em>
execute</a>. Computers are a <em>realization</em> of software. If
you experience a computer, you would probably be most engaged
mentally in the software that it is executing. There is of course
something physical about a computer, something that you can also
experience when it is unplugged, but it is an irrelevant
experience compared to the running of software. </p>

<p>Software executing on a computer is a realization without any
underlying physical realization or embedding. It transcends
reality. </p>

<p>My theme is also summed up by the following definition. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>People </em><a name="communicate"><em>communicate</em></a><em>
    with each other in order to get to workable (realizable)
    meaning. I'd like to consider that in relation to computers,
    whether as a subject or object or tool.</em> </p>
