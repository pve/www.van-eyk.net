<p>One of the pioneers of fractal image compression is Barnsley,
with his firm <a href="http://www.iterated.com/">Iterated systems</a>.
You can have a look at one of my <a href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/peter2.fif">compressed</a>
pictures (17Kbyte), and compare them with a similar <a
href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/peter96.gif">gif</a> (12 Kbyte) or <a href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/peter96.wif">wif
version</a> (4 Kbyte).(wif compression by <a
href="http://www.cengines.com/">Cengines.com</a>).</p>

<p>There is also another type of compression, based on wavelets.
An example of that would be a <a href="dorien.wif.html">wif picture</a>
(16 Kbytes), compared to a <a href="http://www.van-eyk.net/pve/think/dorien.jpg">jpg version</a>
(52 Kbytes).</p>

<p>An analysis of image compression algorithms reveals some
underlying assumptions about the structure of the data, and in
particular assumptions about the structure of the
interpretational systems: the eye and the mind.</p>

<p>The gif format compresses by replacing long sequences of
identical pixels with a special code. This assumes that the
picture has a lot of very evenly colored patches. This tends to
be true for line art and other diagrams.</p>

<p>The jpeg format compresses by taking a spacial fourier
transform of the picture and representing the higher frequency
image components with fewer bits. This works because the eye is
not set up very well to detect absolute color differences, so
that two adjacent pixels that have different colors are, well,
different. On the other hand, the eye has built in
edge-detectors, so that if you have a surface that gradually
changes hue, will appear rippled if this smoothness is not
represented in a precise way.</p>

<p>Wavelet compression is basically an improvement on this.</p>

<p>Fractal compression tries to exploit self similarities in the
image data.</p>
