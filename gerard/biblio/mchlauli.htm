<I>Herebelow is the text of the claim I filed with the Municipality of Upington. On request of the head of the relevant department, Mr L. Mchlauli, I added a few lines about my doings.</I> 

<HR>
Upington, February 11th, 2004

<P>To the Municipality of Upington.

<P>My name is Gérard van Eyk, born 21-09-1929 in Holland. 
<BR>Dutch passport. Citizen of Spain.

<P>I arrived in this country last week for a stay of three months in and around Upington to write about this region. I do so in the form of a daily column in my diary on the web (www.van-eyk.net/gerard/dagboek) and in articles about topical matters of political, cultural or historical nature relating to the region I am in. I am doing this for several years now. I was earlier in SA in 2000 and 2002. I also have been travelling this way in South America, West-Australia and New Zealand. I write generally from the perspective of "the little man in the big world" and looking for a positive view. 'Street observations' could it be named.

<P>Friday Febr 6th, upon arriving in Upington, I found accomodation in Holiday Resort "Die Eiland". I stayed on night in unit &#35;43 as my preferred unit &#35;3, a one-person type was only free from Saturday onwards.

<P>Saturday Febr 7th, around 0830, after having left &#35;43, I booked for &#35;3. The key, they said, was on the frontdoor. That was not the case. I returned to the reception where my observation was met with disbelieve. With me came one of the gatekeepers to have a look for himself. He only could confirm my observation. This gentleman also asked some of the cleaning staff --busy in neighbouring units-- but the key could not be found this way.

<P>As I had all my luggage in my car, I proposed to do some shopping downtown first. I promised the gentleman accompanying me a tin of cool Coca Cola, which I gave him on my return just before 1000. But no key at the gatekeepers lodge! Nor at the reception! They promised to bring it; I should only wait in front of unit &#35;3.

<P>So I did, and took it easy, while reading a book in my car. After quite some time, one of the workmen, who had seen me waiting, enquired what I was waiting for. 'The key', I explained. He shook his head empathicaly and went on to his work.

<P>Still quite some time later, apparantly coming back from his duty deeper in the park, he found that I was still waiting and said: "I will have a look for myself to find it". And, in fact, he returned with a fitting key. The only observation I could make was that is did not have the appearance of a normal guest's key as those are decorated with a mighty leather belt. This one only had a tiny green plastic label. This gave me the impression that is was a spare key or the housekeeper's key. I do not remember if this was said by the man. By that time it was shortly before 1100.

<P>After unpacking my luggage, I left for the Internet café. For that purpose I took the special memory card out of the computer to use it for uploading my work. The computer I left behind on a shelf in the bathroom. I locked the door and closed the window.

<P>On my way out, I stopped at the reception to ask for the key of the small steel safe-cubicle I had found in my unit. I had to come back after 1500, they said, for meeting the right person.

<P>Coming home before 1500, I placed the memory card back in the computer, leaving it on the shelf. I started reading papers in front of the unit until about 1600 when I walked to the reception for the key of the safe-cubicle. I received one, but after trying I had to return, because it didn't work. They explained that is was a new copy and that it surely should work if I tried patiently. I tried again. Without success. I gave up. During both absences I had carefully locked the door behind me. I felt too alert for neglecting this safety routine. 

<P>I continued reading in front of the unit, made a meal for myself and around 1830 I walked up and down the memorable palmtree lane. Of course I had locked the door carefully behind me. Coming home, I found the door locked as I expected, but when I wanted to use my computer, it was gone.

<P>I returned to the gatekeeper's lodge where I met David Van Wyk, a member of the Municipal Police who helped me searching again. No trace of breaking-in could be found. He advised me to make an official report at the SA Police Station. 
<BR>So I did. 

<P>Sunday 8th, I was visited by a Constable of the SA Police. Checking the facts and looking into the matter, she only could conclude that unauthorized persons could easily get into the posession of the keys without management noticing it. She therefore advised to file a claim against the management of Die Eiland and consequently against the Municipality.
<BR>So I am doing.

<P>I therefore claim a compensation of the loss for the Present Value of the stolen equipment, estimated at one third of New Value which results in an indemnification of 12000 ZAR
(Twelve Thousand Rand) to be paid to me.
