<P><font face="Garamond">AS A DEDICATED environmentalist, I consider it a paradox to see today some environmental groups such as Greenpeace 
opposed to nuclear energy. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Nuclear energy can be a very clean energy if it is well-designed, well-constructed, and well-operated: 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">It produces almost no carbon dioxide and other pollutants, ejected in huge quantities into the atmosphere by the use of fossil fuels (millions of tons of sulphur and nitrogen oxides and 
about 30 billion tons of CO are dumped every year into the 
atmosphere). 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">It is very compact (little space is required, 
unlike generators of solar, wind and biomass energy). 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">It produces a very small volume of waste, which decays spontaneously. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">It does not contribute to the greenhouse 
effect. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">In 1996, shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, the non-profit Association of Environmentalists 
For Nuclear Energy was created to inform the public in a complete and 
objective way about energy sources and their environmental impacts. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">EFN is an international network of 5000 members and supporters in 43 countries. It is based on solid scientific 
facts, not ideological considerations. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Among its members is Professor James Lovelock, one of the founders of the development of environmental awareness since the 1960s. Other members are distinguished scientists and 
environmentalists, and some are survivors of the Hiroshima atomic 
explosion.  
 
<P><font face="Garamond">EFN is in favour of clean civilian applications of nuclear energy, such as electricity production and some medical uses, but is strictly opposed to military applications of nuclear 
science. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">EFN bases its position on the fact that nuclear fission is a clean, safe, reliable and competitive energy source, 
that the volume of nuclear waste produced is very small, that the 
waste is confined safely and can be stored safely, and that spent 
fuel is or can be reprocessed, as is the case in France at the La 
Hague reprocessing plant, where 97 per cent of the used nuclear fuel 
is recovered to be recycled and the remaining 3 per cent vitrified 
for safe storage until it decays spontaneously. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Spent nuclear fuel can and should be reprocessed, for environmental reasons if not for economic ones. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">To combat the greenhouse effect and the consequent global-warming trend, nuclear fission is the only source of energy that can replace a significant part of the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas without polluting the atmosphere. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Clearly, renewable energies and energy 
conservation should be encouraged, but will not suffice to ensure the 
development of developing countries or drive our industrial 
societies; neither will they save the world from the dramatic energy 
crisis and transition that humanity will have to face soon, because 
of the risks and consequences of climate change on one hand and the 
progressive extinction of oil and gas reserves in the coming decades 
on the other. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Wind and solar energy produce, inconsistently, kilowatts (or at best a few megawatts here and there), but today's populations consume gigawatts and terawatts (that is to say, 
thousands or millions of times as much). 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Whatever contribution these renewable energies may bring will be useful, but they should not be expected to contribute otherwise than in a marginal way to facing the world's growing energy demand. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Nuclear energy is the only source of energy that can and should replace fossil fuels whenever possible in the coming 
years. At the same time, more efficient use of energy and 
self-sustainable life styles should be promoted. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Renewable energies should not be excluded and it should be recognised that the latter have important niche roles to 
play, although their industrial potential is almost negligible. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">The opposition of the environmental movement to civilian applications of nuclear energy will in time be revealed as 
among the greatest mistakes of our times. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Today, electricity can be produced cleanly with almost no CO2 emissions (electricity, for example, is 80 per cent 
nuclear and 15 per cent hydraulic in France, the cleanest and 
cheapest electricity produced in Europe). Tomorrow, nuclear energy 
will be the key also to desalination of sea water and hydrogen 
production. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">One gram of uranium or thorium yields as much 
energy as one tonne of coal. It's the "factor one million" effect. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Nuclear energy's potential is indeed a million times as great as that of fossil fuels, which produce 90 per cent of the world's energy today. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">These precious and polluting fossil energies 
should be saved for the specific needs for which they cannot be replaced, such as fuelling aircraft or providing energy for developing countries. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">They should be replaced urgently wherever possible by less polluting sources of energy such as nuclear and, with a much smaller potential, renewable energy. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">The opposition of the environmental movement to civilian applications of nuclear energy will in time be revealed as 
among the greatest mistakes of our times. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">An intelligent combination of energy conservation, to whatever extent is possible, nuclear energy for base-load 
electricity production and renewable energies for local low-intensity 
applications, is the way for the future. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">EFN's membership is growing rapidly, as an 
increasing number of people realise the environmental benefits of an 
intelligent use of nuclear energy. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Local groups and associations of EFN are active and becoming increasingly popular in many countries. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">I invite the readers of The Canberra Times to 
organise some local activities. 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Why not form a local chapter of EFN in 
Australia? 
 
<P><font face="Garamond">Those who share our views may sign the petition, on the Internet, in favour of clean nuclear energy, and contact EFN to become </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ecolo.org/corloc/corlocen.htm"><font face="Garamond">local correspondents</FONT></A>.
