      <P>William George Malone was one of New Zealand's outstanding soldiers of 
      the Gallipoli campaign. He was born in England at Rushey Green, Lewisham, 
      Kent, on 24 January 1859, the third of five children of Louisa Childs and 
      her husband, Thomas Augustine Malone, an Irish Catholic and a chemist by 
      profession. Thomas Malone's early death in 1867 appears to have left the 
      family in difficult financial circumstances. William, nevertheless, was 
      educated by Marist brothers at boarding schools in England and France. 
      Here he acquired the conservatism and determination to master anything he 
      attempted which were to characterise him in later life. Malone continued 
      his schooling in France until 1876, becoming fluent in French and a 
      competent pianist. Returning to London he worked in an office, and began 
      his links with the military by enlisting in the City of Westminster Rifle 
      Volunteers; he also served in the Royal Artillery Volunteers.</P>
      <P>In January 1880 Malone arrived in Taranaki, New Zealand, as a steerage 
      passenger on the <I>Western Monarch </I>to join his elder brother, Austin. 
      William joined the Armed Constabulary and served with his brother at 
      Opunake, and also took part in the attack on Parihaka in November 1881. He 
      resigned from the Armed Constabulary in 1882 and worked in surf-boats and 
      lightering on the Opunake coast and took up land with Austin near 
      Stratford. The brothers arranged for their mother and two sisters to join 
      them in New Zealand. On 27 November 1886 William married Elinor Lucy Penn 
      at New Plymouth. They had four sons and one daughter before Elinor died 
      giving birth at New Plymouth on 18 June 1904. In Christchurch on 11 
      September the following year he married Ida Katherine Withers, 16 years 
      his junior, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.</P>
      <P>Malone was active in local affairs as chairman of the Ngaire Road Board 
      from 1883, and a member of the Hawera County Council (1885--1890) and the 
      Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. He played an important role in 
      forming the Stratford County Council and was its first clerk and 
      treasurer. He was appointed a justice of the peace in 1892.</P>
      <P>Malone always saw himself as a farmer and working man, and farmed a 
      large block of land at Puniwhakau, near Stratford. About 1890, however, he 
      began business in Stratford as a land and commission agent. He also began 
      to study law at night while farming by day. Admitted as a solicitor on 19 
      April 1894, he qualified as a barrister five years later.</P>
      <P>In 1903 Malone formed a law partnership with James McVeagh and W. D. 
      Anderson, opening branches in several Taranaki towns. He moved to New 
      Plymouth in the same year. Much of his legal business involved land 
      transactions. A strong supporter of freehold land tenure, he 
      unsuccessfully contested the Taranaki electorate as an independent Liberal 
      in 1907 and 1908. In 1911 he sold his share of the legal practice and 
      returned to Stratford, where he acted as solicitor to many of the town's 
      leading businesses.</P>
      <P>It is for his military achievements that William Malone is best known. 
      During the South African War he assisted in raising the Stratford Rifle 
      Volunteers and served as captain. By 1910 he had become lieutenant colonel 
      and commanding officer of 4th Battalion, Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle 
      Volunteers. He was a strong advocate of compulsory military training and 
      in 1911 was appointed to command the 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles).</P>
      <P>At the annual camp in 1911 he introduced the 'lemon squeezer' as the 
      regimental hat. Malone's purpose was both to mirror the outline of Mt 
      Egmont, and also to allow for run-off in the rain. In September 1916 it 
      was adopted by the New Zealand military, and it remains the distinctive 
      ceremonial head-dress of the New Zealand army.</P>
      <P>On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Malone was appointed to command 
      the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The 
      oldest man in the battalion, he was 'fit, hard &amp; well', almost six 
      feet tall and of solid build. Malone was determined to make his battalion 
      the best in the force. He had spent 15 years reading military history and 
      strategy, and was achieving a lifelong ambition by going to war. In 
      training in Egypt in late 1914 and early 1915 he drove his battalion 
      mercilessly and they hated him for it. He weeded out those who did not 
      meet his standards and worked his men harder and longer than those of any 
      other battalion in the brigade.</P>
      <P>As part of the ANZAC Corps, the Wellington Battalion landed on the 
      Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April. Malone immediately began to impose order. 
      By example, determination and drive he transformed weak defences held by 
      frightened men into ordered garrisons which dominated their Turkish 
      opponents. He consolidated and secured the ANZAC Corps perimeter whenever 
      it was threatened. The losses suffered at Helles on 8 May confirmed for 
      him that 'this is the day of digging and machine guns and that prepared 
      positions cannot be rushed'. As post commander at Courtney's Post and 
      Quinn's Post between June and August he put this into practice by 
      consolidating a precarious position at Quinn's Post, where an advance of 
      20 metres by the Turks would have forced the evacuation of the ANZAC 
      Corps.</P>
      <P>Malone fought his superiors for building material and for basic 
      comforts for his men as fiercely as he fought the Turks. His diaries chart 
      a growing disenchantment with impractical British regular officers, and a 
      growing love for his men. Malone would not take 'no' for an answer, and 
      this led to a clash of wills between him and his New Zealand Infantry 
      Brigade commander, Colonel F. E. Johnston, and his staff. Malone survived 
      with the support of Johnston's superiors, Major General Sir A. J. Godley, 
      commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division, and Lieutenant 
      General Sir William Birdwood, commanding the ANZAC Corps.</P>
      <P>The Wellington Battalion played a pivotal part in the August offensive. 
      After a confusing night march, at dawn on 7 August they secured the Apex 
      on Rhododendron Ridge some 500 metres below the infantry brigade's 
      objective of Chunuk Bair. The opportunity was there for the brigade to 
      push on and seize the heights overlooking the Dardanelles, but the 
      exhausted Johnston vacillated until directed to advance by Godley. The 
      Auckland Battalion made a daylight attack, but was destroyed by Turkish 
      fire as it tried to advance up the ridge. Malone was ordered to continue 
      the attack. He refused: 'I'm not going to send them over to commit 
      suicide.' Johnston agreed that the attack be delayed until before dawn. 
      Malone's battalion seized Chunuk Bair on 8 August; there was little 
      opposition.</P>
      <P>Turkish counter-attacks began at daylight and the two British 
      battalions with the Wellingtons crumpled and some of their soldiers ran. 
      Malone personally led counter-attacks to keep the crest clear of Turkish 
      troops. Little communication was possible with brigade headquarters, but 
      at midday some Auckland Mounted Rifles got forward to reinforce Malone's 
      men. At 5 p.m. supporting artillery fire, probably from a New Zealand 
      howitzer battery, burst over Malone's trench and killed him. By then the 
      Turkish counter-attacks had ceased. That night, when the Wellingtons were 
      relieved by other New Zealand units, some 70 of the battalion's 760 men 
      remained.</P>
      <P>The seizure of Chunuk Bair was the one success of the August offensive. 
      It was not exploited. The New Zealanders held the seaward slopes for 
      another 24 hours until relieved by British troops, who were then driven 
      off on 10 August. Malone's body remained on Chunuk Bair, one of 310 
      Wellington soldiers who have no known graves. In death Malone unfairly 
      became the scapegoat for the failure of the offensive.</P>
      <P>William Malone was an outstanding battalion commander who proved in 
      action to have the capacity for higher command. His efforts in August 
      almost compensated for the ineptness displayed by his superior commanders. 
      The tenacity displayed by the Wellington Battalion on Chunuk Bair on 8 
      August 1915 embodied the spirit of their commanding 
  officer.</P></FONT>
