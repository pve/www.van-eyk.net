<P>It was lunchtime on Thursday, and George W Bush stood behind his Oval Office 
desk, the desk used before him by Presidents Clinton and Kennedy. He shifted his 
weight uneasily, or in excitement, from one foot to the other, while speaking on 
the phone to the Governor and Mayor of New York. When he put down the receiver, 
looking grim but determined, he addressed assembled reporters, speaking in 
self-consciously high-flown terms about "winning the first war of the 21st 
century".</P>
<P>Thus far, it was an old-fashioned scene, with an old-fashioned phone, staged 
for the cameras as a demonstration of solidarity with New York, and of 
presidential authority. The President, this miniature production said, was at 
his post and at one with the American people.</P>
<P>But then, asked about his personal response to what was by now known to be 
the most devastating terrorist attack on any country, ever, the theatre suddenly 
lapsed. The President turned away for a second, then turned back, with tears 
visibly welling in his eyes, and went on: "Well, I don't think of myself right 
now. I think about the families, the children. I'm a loving guy. And I am also 
someone, however, who's got a job to do and I intend to do it... This country 
will not relent until we have saved ourselves, and others, from the terrible 
tragedy that came upon America."</P>
<P>For almost the first time in his nine months in the White House, Americans 
caught a glimpse of their notably unflappable and scripted President giving way 
to genuine and spontaneous emotion. What will become apparent only with 
hindsight is whether that moment was a mark of strength or of weakness, as the 
next days and weeks show whether the second President Bush is really up to the 
job.</P>
<P>When George W Bush swore the oath of office on 20 January, he was one of the 
least experienced chief executives the United States had ever elected. The 
aftermath of last week's catastrophic terrorist onslaught, however, is fast 
making him one of the most experienced, in intensity, if not in breadth. In four 
days and nights this week, President Bush has been exposed to some of the most 
acute dangers and most intense emotions that any recent president has had to 
confront.</P>
<P>He was peacefully reading to primary school children in Florida when he 
learned that first one, and then the second of New York's World Trade Centre 
towers had been hit by two hijacked American planes. He was in Air Force One 
flying home to Washington when he learned that the Pentagon, the nerve-centre of 
the country's defences, had been hit by a third errant plane, and apparently in 
a holding pattern over northern Florida when word came that a fourth US 
passenger plane had crashed – en route, it was believed – for Camp David, the 
White House, or even his own plane.</P>
<P>He spent the rest of the day flitting across the country of which he was 
leader – dispatched under fighter-plane escort – to an air force base in 
Louisiana, to a fortified bunker in Nebraska, and finally back to Washington in 
time to make an evening broadcast to a shocked and, until that hour, seemingly 
leaderless nation. He spoke – at times hesitantly – about hunting down the 
culprits, about vanquishing terrorism, and about evil.</P>
<P>The ensuing days were spent in a feverish race to recover the commanding 
heights of his office. His advisers have spun tales of how he repeatedly 
contested the advice of the Secret Service and his Vice-President to seek refuge 
in the nuclear bunker in Nebraska. His father, the previous President Bush, was 
wheeled out to express irritation with those who criticised his son for not 
returning immediately to Washington and to say, somewhat feebly: "I know he is 
strong."</P>
<P>In that time, the world has seen the worst and the best of George W Bush. At 
worst, he has been inarticulate and inconsequential. He has looked small, 
diffident and uncertain. At best, he has been unflinching, single-minded and so 
patently sincere and distressed that it was wrenching to watch.</P>
<P>The temptation is to say that there is nothing in George Bush's life or 
career that has prepared him for the testing time he now faces. But then no US 
president, with the possible exception of Franklin D Roosevelt after the 
Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, has faced anything even remotely equivalent. 
Several thousand, perhaps many thousand, Americans are dead: they include 
several hundred passengers in civilian aircraft who were able to phone their 
last desperate messages home. They include a hundred or more defence department 
staff, 400 New York rescue workers and thousands who simply set off for lower 
Manhattan one morning, never to return. Buildings symbolic of American success 
have been destroyed or critically damaged, deliberately, with extreme violence 
and with malice aforethought. America has reacted with angry defiance and an 
outpouring of militant patriotism; it is baying for blood.</P>
<P>To exercise leadership, while reflecting and tempering public sentiment, 
would be a great deal to ask of any president, especially one whose life 
hitherto has been one of such ease. The eldest son of the prosperous and 
well-connected George H W Bush, George W has led a gilded existence. His family 
was not only wealthy, but solid and respected. He attended the best schools and 
colleges that money and privilege could provide. He went from the select Andover 
College in New England, to Yale, obtaining an adequate, if undistinguished 
degree in history, before – unlike many of his less fortunate contemporaries – 
successfully avoiding military service in Vietnam, without joining the protest 
movement or breaking the law.</P>
<P>Assured through family contacts of acceptance, he volunteered for the Texas 
Air National Guard, a safe option that allowed him to live the life of a 
part-time playboy – drinking to excess, and perhaps experimenting with drugs – 
while also training to fly. He was, by all accounts, a competent, if at times 
over-intrepid pilot, traits that live on in the way he now drives his Jeeps 
around the grounds of his Texas ranch.</P>
<P>In the fullness of time, George W knuckled down to take a business degree at 
Harvard, one of the qualifications most prized by American business. But instead 
of using his master's degree as a leg-up to a large salary at a multi-national, 
he set up on his own in the oil business in western Texas, a state, and a 
region, that he has adopted as his own. Texas appealed to him, he has said, 
because of its wildness and scale and because of the quintessentially American 
sense of opportunity that he found in the oil prospectors' town of Midland.</P>
<P>From then on, he mingled business and politics, neither with marked success. 
He was bailed out of near-failure in his oil-drilling business by a combination 
of family contacts and personal charm. Always a bit of a salesman, he seemed to 
have no trouble drawing richer and more qualified people to his side and using 
them to their mutual advantage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was in his post-MBA Midland years that he was introduced to Laura Welch, a 
Midland native and now school librarian, who, like him, had passed the age of 30 
and still remained single. Within six months they had married: a decision he 
regularly recounts as the best of his life. Laura, as he and some of their 
mutual friends present it, performed the classic role of redemptive woman. 
Capable and calm, she settled him down, smoothed some rough corners, and 
campaigned loyally by his side as he made his first – unsuccessful – sortie into 
politics.</P>
<P>Laura is also credited with laying down the ultimatum that led to George W to 
decide on the day after his 40th birthday to give up drinking, the last vestige 
of his mis-spent youth. He later admitted (when the presidential campaign was 
safely over) that his over-indulgence had threatened to become more central to 
his life than his family. It had also brought him trouble with the law on at 
least one occasion, bringing him a drink-driving ticket that came to light 20 
years later, perilously close to presidential election day.</P>
<P>But George W did not just give up drinking. Thanks to the evangelist, Billy 
Graham, he says, he also turned in a big way to God. He counts himself as a 
born-again Christian in the Southern, fundamentalist mode, opposes abortion, 
reads the Bible every day and starts meals with grace. He also has a firm sense 
of personal morality that caused him, as Governor of Texas, to have a young 
woman staff member who flirted with him removed from his office on the grounds 
that his marriage was for life and adultery was against the Ten 
Commandments.</P>
<P>While President Bush would hardly claim to have been tested in anything like 
the same crucible of life as his predecessor, Bill Clinton, his fellow Texan, 
Lyndon B Johnson or FDR, there are also features and chapters of his life that 
suggest he may not be so ill-equipped to deal with this epic American crisis 
after all.</P>
<P>To be sure, he is nothing like as contagiously emotional or empathetic as 
Bill Clinton, but he has known personal loss. He vividly recalls still the day 
that his parents returned home one day without his three-year old sister, Robin, 
who had died of leukaemia in hospital.</P>
<P>Mr Bush may have scraped through his first degree at Yale, but a Harvard MBA 
is a more difficult project to "wing". Whatever people say about his wily, and 
highly political charm, or the luck and connections that made him part-owner and 
full-time manager of the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989 – and also made his 
personal fortune – few question his managerial competence. He is the first 
trained manager to attain the presidency of the United States, a position 
sometimes described as the world's chief executive officer – and that may be no 
bad thing to be at a time of such crisis.</P>
<P>In naming and structuring his administration, President Bush applied 
managerial principles of line management and personal accountability, as indeed 
he did as Governor of Texas. He delegates without qualms – some say he delegates 
too much. While delegating, however, he demands utter loyalty, both personal and 
professional, a requirement that may again stand him in good stead in the trials 
to come. He also trusts proven ability. He had no difficulty in attracting to 
his administration a team of professionals who had no need to serve in 
government to prove their worth and who – in several cases – suffered severe 
material loss by joining or returning to public service.</P>
<P>There have been times, when such individuals – the Defence Secretary, Donald 
Rumsfeld, the Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, to name but two – have seemed 
liabilities because of their lack of political finesse. With the Twin Towers in 
rubble, lower Manhattan a virtual war zone, and the Pentagon in flames, these 
may be exactly the sort of people Mr Bush needs around him. Mr Rumsfeld might 
have alienated large numbers of the top brass with his outspoken plans for 
military reform, but last Tuesday, he refused evacuation, remained at his 
Pentagon desk throughout the day and even helped with the rescue effort. Such 
gritty subordinates are just what a president needs if, as appears, he is 
contemplating going to war.</P>
<P>Nor may Mr Bush himself be quite as diffident and short on that indefinable 
quality known as character as his inarticulacy and timid body language often 
suggest. He ran for office – both for Congress (when he lost) and for Governor 
of Texas (when he won) against all the odds. As his presidential campaign also 
testified, he is not afraid of competing, and he does not wilt under pressure. 
He has a streak of the gambler, but not to the point of unreason. He fought 
fiercely for the White House once it was within his grasp, his doughty, 
ruthless, seconds bearing the brunt of the battle.</P>
<P>Mr Bush is also strong-minded. When he decided to marry, he remained 
faithful. When he decided to quit the bottle, that is what he did – just like 
that. He prides himself on being able to take tough decisions. So far, that 
quality has not been much in evidence; in practice – as with his compromise on 
stemm-cell research – he has preferred diplomatic wordplay to dividing American 
(or congressional) opinion. But with the country united behind him, and one 
enemy – the as yet unidentified terrorists – in his sights, the "tough" decision 
on retaliation may not in fact be so tough. The tricky part could come later if 
a military operation somehow went wrong.</P>
<P>Through his family background and his religion, President Bush has also 
developed a strong sense of what is appropriate to the presidency. His campaign 
pledge to "restore honour and dignity to the White House" was in part a 
political swipe against the outgoing Bill Clinton. But it was also a clear 
statement about the duties of the President, as he saw the office embodied by 
his father. These would undoubtedly include the belief that the office of 
president is greater than any one individual, that the good of the nation 
supersedes the interests of the individual, and that the United States, as a 
fount of democracy and freedom, has a duty of leadership to the rest of the 
world.</P>
<P>Such sentiments may sound unsophisticated and trite, even questionable, in 
many places outside America. But they are an integral part of many Americans' 
view of their president, and while there is no evidence at all that Bill Clinton 
did not subscribe to these American values, they were especially associated with 
the first President Bush.</P>
<P>The son of that decent, but ultimately failed, president is now at a historic 
moment in his presidency. It is one of those times when the judgement and 
character of one individual can determine not only his fate, but that of his 
nation, even that of the world.</P>
<P>Before last Tuesday, Mr Bush appeared to be floundering. The first year of 
his presidency looked set to be marked by the same sort of economic decline and 
political drift that had doomed the presidency of his father. He appeared too 
keen to forge consensus at the expense of clear principle. He had given to the 
rich without consoling the poor. He was felt to have betrayed his promise to 
govern from the centre, and his tax cuts were on the verge of exhausting the 
Clinton term's record surplus. Through heavy-handed diplomacy and ignorance of 
the world, he had alienated the international coalition so painstakingly put 
together by his father to fight the Gulf war and sustained by Bill Clinton.</P>
<P>Tuesday's cataclysm gives George W Bush's presidency a new start, in a new 
world. The line between friends and enemies is suddenly clear; the gulf between 
home and abroad has closed. In one of several televised speeches this week, he 
told Americans with rare directness and conviction: "Our battle will take time 
and resolve, and make no mistake, we will prevail."</P>
<P>One of the earliest and most enduring themes of Mr Bush's presidential 
campaign was his claim to be a leader. That claim derived from his five years 
and re-election as Governor of Texas, from his five years as manager of the 
Texas Rangers, and last, but not least, from an inherited sense of his destiny. 
He now has the chance of a lifetime to prove that claim. </P>
