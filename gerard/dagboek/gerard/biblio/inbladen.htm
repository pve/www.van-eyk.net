Bush: The new statesman?</A>

<P>The first time I met Osama bin Laden inside Afghanistan it was a hot, humid 
night in the summer of 1996. Huge insects flew through the night air, settling 
like burrs on his Saudi robes and on the clothes of his armed followers. They 
would land on my notebook until I swatted them, their blood smearing the pages. 
Bin Laden was always studiously polite: each time we met, he would offer the 
usual Arab courtesy of food for a stranger: a tray of cheese, olives, bread and 
jam. I had already met him in Sudan and would spend a night, almost a year 
later, in one of his mountain guerrilla camps, so cold that I awoke in the 
morning with ice in my hair.</P>
<P>I had been given a rough blanket and my shoes were left outside the tent. 
Whenever we met, he would interrupt our interviews to say his prayers, his armed 
followers – from Algeria, Egypt, the Gulf Arab states, Syria – kneeling beside 
him, hanging on his every word as he spoke to me as if he was a messiah.</P>
<P>On 20 March, 1997, I would meet him again. Although only 41 at the time, his 
ruggedly groomed beard had white hairs, and he had bags under his eyes; I sensed 
some infirmity, a stiffness of one leg that gave him the slightest of limps. I 
still have my notes, scribbled in the frozen semi-darkness as an oil lamp 
sputtered between us. "I am not against the American people," he said. "Only 
their government." I had heard this so often in the Middle East. I told him I 
thought the American people regarded their government as their representatives. 
Bin Laden listened to this in silence. "We are still at the beginning of our 
military action against the American forces," he said.</P>
<P>I remembered those words this week as I watched those airliners scything into 
the World Trade Centre towers. And I remembered, too, how in that last meeting 
he had seized on the Arabic-language newspapers I was carrying in my satchel (a 
schoolbag I use in rough countries) and scurried to a corner of the tent to read 
them for 20 minutes, ignoring both his fighters and myself. Although a Saudi, he 
did not even know that the Iranian foreign minister had just visited the Saudi 
capital of Riyadh. Didn't he even have a radio, I asked myself? Was this really 
the "godfather of world terror?" The US administration and <I>Time</I> magazine 
had both blessed him with this sobriquet. I rather thought he would have liked 
that. And the $5 million reward that the American administration offered for 
him. As a multi-millionaire himself, bin Laden would have been insulted at such 
a low price on the "wanted" poster.</P>
<P>The bin Ladens are a construction family, respected in their native Saudi 
Arabia although their roots lie on the Yemeni border, a family who honoured the 
young man who, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, took his 
followers and his road construction machinery to a volcanic landscape of tribal 
leaders to fight "the West". For the Russians – to a Saudi – were Westerners and 
their incursion into Islamic Afghanistan was a heretical, corrupting act. He 
paid from his own packet to fly thousands of young Arab Muslims to fight 
alongside him.</P>
<P>They came – from Algeria, from Egypt and the Arabian Gulf and from Syria – 
and many of them died as martyrs in the ferocious battles, torn to pieces by 
mines, shredded by the machine-gun fire of the Soviet Hind helicopter gunships 
that raided the villages of Panchir.</P>
<P>The first time we met, in Sudan, I persuaded bin Laden – much against his 
will – to talk about those days. And he recalled how, during an attack on a 
Russian firebase not far from Jalalabad, a mortar shell had fallen at his feet. 
He had waited for it to explode. And in those milliseconds of rationality, he 
had – so he said – felt a great sense of tranquillity, a sense of calm 
acceptance which he ascribed to God. The shell – and many an American may now 
wish the opposite had happened – failed to explode.</P>
<P>Even the Russians came to know of the esteem in which bin Laden was held 
among the Afghan resistance. In Moscow in 1993, I met a Soviet adviser who was 
supposed to arrange his liquidation. "A dangerous man,'' the Russian said of bin 
Laden. At the time, of course, the Americans loved him, provided him with 
weapons, never dreaming that within two decades they, too, would be dreaming of 
his murder. Bin Laden told me once that he never met an American agent during 
the anti-Russian war, never accepted a single bullet from the West.</P>
<P>But his bulldozers and earth-removers carved highways through the mountains 
for the Mujahedin to carry their British-made Blowpipe anti-aircraft missiles 
high enough to strike the Soviet Migs; years later, one of his armed followers 
would take me up the "bin Laden trail", a terrifying two-hour odyssey along 
fearful ravines in rain and sleet, the windscreen misting as we climbed the cold 
mountain. "When you believe in <I>jihad</I> [holy war], it is easy,'' the gunman 
informed me, fighting with the steering wheel as stones scuttered from the 
tyres, bouncing down the valleys into the clouds below. From time to time – this 
was in 1997 – lights winked at us from far away in the darkness. "Our brothers 
are letting us know they see us,'' the gunman said. It was two hours more before 
we reached bin Laden's old wartime camp, the jeep skidding backwards towards 
sheer cliffs, the headlights illuminating frozen waterfalls above. "Toyota is 
good for <I>Jihad</I>,'' bin Laden's man smiled. I could only agree. I never 
heard bin Laden make a joke.</P>
<P>If the United States regarded him as the foremost "terrorist'' in the world – 
as I told him they did – then "if liberating my land is called terrorism, this 
is a great honour for me.'' There was no difference, he said, between the 
American and Israeli governments, between the American and Israeli armies. But 
Europe – especially France – was beginning to distance itself from the 
Americans. He did condemn French policy towards north Africa; although he did 
not mention Algeria, the name hovered over us for several minutes like a 
ghost.</P>
<P>Bin Laden gave me a Pakistani wall poster in Urdu which proclaimed the 
support of Pakistani scholars for his "holy war'' against the Americans; he even 
handed to me colour photographs of graffiti on the walls of Karachi that 
demanded the ousting of US troops from "the place of the two Holy shrines [Mecca 
and Medina]''. He had, he claimed, received some months ago an emissary from the 
Saudi royal family who said that his Saudi citizenship -- taken away after 
pressure from Washington – would be restored along with a new Saudi passport and 
2 billion Saudi riyals (£339 million) for his family if he abandoned his 
<I>jihad</I> and went back to Saudi Arabia. He and his family, he said, had 
rejected the offer.</P>
<P>At the time, bin Laden had three wives, the elder of them the mother of his 
bright, 16-year-old Bon Omar, the youngest herself a teenager. Another son, 
Saad, was brought to meet me; they spoke some English and were clearly excited – 
in an innocent way – to be surrounded by so many armed men. All lived with him – 
along with other Mujahedin wives and children -- and stayed in a compound 
outside Jalalabad. Bin Laden even invited me to visit these hot, dank, miserable 
homes in the company of one of his Egyptian fighters. Of course, his wives – the 
youngest was later to return to her family in the Gulf – were not there. "These 
are ladies who are used to living in comfort,'' the Egyptian said. The 
encampment was protected by sheets of canvas and a few strands of barbed wire; a 
drainage ditch and three separate latrines had been dug in the earth, in one of 
which floated a dead frog. The Egyptian's teenage son, sitting beside us with a 
rifle in his lap, insisted that Egyptian Intelligence men had viewed the camp. 
"There are people in the towns who work for the Americans,'' he said. "We see 
these people and we have to be careful.''</P>
<P>Another of the Arabs in that camp was more forthcoming. There was, he said, 
"no other country left for Mr bin Laden'' outside of Afghanistan. "When he was 
in Sudan, the Saudis wanted to capture him with the help of the Yemenis. We know 
that the French government tried to persuade the Sudanese to hand him over to 
them because the Sudanese had given them a south American. The Americans were 
pressing the French to get hold of bin Laden in Sudan. An Arab group paid by the 
Saudis tried to kill him, but bin Laden's guards fired back and two were 
wounded.''</P>
<P>In all, bin Laden lost 500 of his men in the war against the Russians. Their 
graves lie near the Pakistani border at Torkum. After the Russian withdrawal, 
bin Laden left for Sudan, disgusted by the Afghans' internecine fighting. His 
closest followers went with him to build highways and invest in Sudanese 
industry.</P>
<P>Bin Laden is a tall, slim man and towers over his companions.</P>
<P>He has narrow, dark eyes which stared hard at me when he spoke of his hatred 
of Saudi corruption. Indeed, in my long conversation with bin Laden in 1996 – on 
that hot night of mosquitoes – the Saudi kingdom and its apparatchiks probably 
consumed more time than his views of America. He picked his teeth with a piece 
of miswak wood, a habit that accompanied all his conversations with me. History 
– or his version of it – was the basis of almost all his remarks. And the 
pivotal date was 1990, the year Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. "When the 
American troops entered Saudi Arabia, the land of the two Holy places, there was 
as strong protest from the ulema [religious authorities] and from students of 
the Sharia law all over the country against the interference of American 
troops.</P>
<P>"This big mistake by the Saudi regime of inviting the American troops 
revealed their deception. They had given their support to nations that were 
fighting against Muslims. They helped the Yemen communists against the southern 
Yemeni Muslims and are helping [Yasser] Arafat's regime fight Hamas. After it 
insulted and jailed the ulema ... the Saudi regime lost its legitimacy.''</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bin Laden paused to see if I had listened to his careful if frighteningly 
exclusive history lesson. "We as Muslims have a strong feeling that binds us 
together... We feel for our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon. The explosion at 
Khobar did not come as a direct result of American occupation but as a result of 
American behaviour against Muslims...</P>
<P>"When 60 Jews are killed inside Palestine [in suicide bombings in 1996], all 
the world gathers within seven days to criticise this action, while the deaths 
of 600,000 Iraqi children [under UN sanctions] did not receive the same 
reaction. Killing those Iraqi children is a crusade against Islam. We, as 
Muslims, do not like the Iraqi regime but we think that the Iraqi people and 
their children are our brothers and we care about their future."</P>
<P>But it was America that captured bin Laden's final attention. "I believe that 
sooner or later the Americans will leave Saudi Arabia, and that the war declared 
by America against the Saudi people means war against Muslims everywhere. 
Resistance against America will spread in many, many places in Muslim countries. 
Our trusted leaders, the ulema, have given us a fatwa that we must drive out the 
Americans. The solution to this crisis is the withdrawal of American troops... 
their military presence is an insult to the Saudi people.''</P>
<P>I've been thinking a lot about that last statement this week. American forces 
are still in Saudi Arabia. And about his earlier remark in July, 1996 – after a 
truck bomb had killed 19 Americans – that this incident marked "the beginning of 
the war between Muslims and the United States". Of the later bombing and the 
killing of 24 US servicemen, he was to tell me that it was "a great act in which 
I missed the honour of participating". He spoke then in a chilling, lower voice 
of his hatred of the American "occupiers".</P>
<P>Intelligent – and eloquent in Arabic – bin Laden undoubtedly is. But his 
understanding of foreign affairs is decidedly eccentric. At one point, he even 
suggested to me that individual US states might secede from the Union because of 
Washington's support for Israel. But the historical perspective was deeply 
disturbing. "We believe that God used our holy war in Afghanistan to destroy the 
Russian army and the Soviet Union,'' he said. "We did this from the top of this 
very mountain on which you are sitting – and now we ask God to use us one more 
time to do the same to America, to make it a shadow of itself. We also believe 
that our battle against America is much simpler than the war against the Soviet 
Union because some of our Mujahedin who fought here in Afghanistan also 
participated in operations against the Americans in Somalia [during the doomed 
UN mission] – and they were surprised at the collapse of American morale. This 
convinced us that the Americans are a paper tiger.</P>
<P>He was also to tell me that "swift and light forces working in complete 
secrecy" would be needed to oust America from Saudi Arabia. In the following two 
years, bin Laden was to form his al-Qaeda movement and declare war on the 
American people – not just the government and army of the United States. There 
would follow the near-sinking of the USS <I>Cole</I> in Aden harbour – by 
suicide bombers – and the Cruise missile attacks on the old CIA base that bin 
Laden uses in southern Afghanistan. He walks now with a stick – a development of 
the foot problem I noticed four years ago – and speaks more slowly.</P>
<P>But could he really command an army of suicide bombers from the desolation of 
the Afghan mountains? He did admit to me once that he knew two of the three men 
executed – beheaded – in Saudi Arabia for bombing the second American military 
base. He wanted a "real" Islamic sharia law government in Arabia – there would, 
I suspected, be even more head-chopping in a bin Laden regime – and he wanted an 
end to those dictators installed by the Americans, those men who supported US 
policies while repressing their own people.</P>
<P>And it occurred to me that this was, for many millions of Arabs in the Middle 
East, a very powerful message. You didn't need instructions from bin Laden to 
form your own small group of followers, to decide on your own individual 
actions. Bin Laden wouldn't have to plan bombings or the overthrow of regimes. 
You had only to listen to the thousands of cassette tapes of his voice 
circulated clandestinely around the Middle East. Which is why I wonder – always 
supposing bin Laden is connected to the crime against humanity committed in the 
United States this week – if it would even be necessary to command a 
para-military organisation for such acts to happen. Arabs are angry enough with 
the injustices that they blame on America without needing orders from 
Afghanistan. Inspiration might be just enough.</P>
<P>And I wondered, after those images from New York last week, whether bin Laden 
was not as astonished as myself to see them. Always supposing he watched 
television. Or listened to the radio. Or read a newspaper. </P>
