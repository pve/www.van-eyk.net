<P><B>The Six Principles of Economic 
Aristocracy</B></A>
<P><B>1. Worldview<BR></B>In 
the spirit of aristocracy, the corporation discriminates based on 
property --paying stockholders as much as 
possible, and employees as little as possible.
<P><B>2. 
Privilege<BR></B>Stockholders claim wealth they do little to create, 
much as nobles claimed privilege they did not earn. 
<P><B>3. 
Property<BR></B>Like a feudal estate, a corporation is considered a 
piece of property --not a human community-- so it can be owned and sold by the 
propertied class.
<P><B>4. 
Governance<BR></B>Corporations function with an aristocratic 
governance structure, where members of the propertied class alone may 
vote. 
<P><B>5. 
Liberty<BR></B>Corporate capitalism embraces a predemocratic concept 
of liberty reserved for property holders, which thrives by restricting the 
liberty of employees and the community.
<P><B>6. 
Sovereignty<BR></B>Corporations assert they are private and the free 
market will self-regulate, much as feudal barons asserted a sovereignty 
independent of the Crown.
<P><B>The Six Principles of Economic 
Democracy</B></A>
<P><B>1. 
Enlightenment<BR></B>Because all persons are created equal, the 
economic rights of employees and the community are equal to those of 
capital owners.
<P><B>2. 
Equality<BR></B>Under market principles, wealth does not legitimately 
belong only to stockholders. Corporate wealth belongs to those who create 
it, and community wealth belongs to all. 
<P><B>3. Public 
Good<BR></B>As semipublic governments, public corporations are more 
than pieces of property or private contracts. They have a responsibility 
to the public good.
<P><B>4. 
Democracy<BR></B>The corporation is a human community, and like the 
larger community of which it is a part, it is best governed 
democratically.
<P><B>5. Justice<BR></B>In 
keeping with equal treatment of persons before the law, the wealthy may 
not claim greater rights than others, and corporations may not claim the 
rights of persons. 
<P><B>6. 
(r)Evolution<BR></B>As it is the right of the people to alter or 
abolish government, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish the 
corporations that now govern the world.
