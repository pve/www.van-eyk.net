<P><FONT class=black face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2> It is a special pleasure for me to give a lecture named in honor of John M. Gaus. My files still retain several gracious letters from him to a young colleague, one after a session in which we had participated at the 1950 APSA meeting; another commenting on a paper I had published in APSR in 1953. 
            <P>When I encountered the world of public administration 65 years 
            ago, John Gaus was just undertaking, with Leon O. Wolcott, their 
            remarkable study, Public Administration and the United States 
            Department of Agriculture (1940). Don Smithburg, Vic Thompson, and I 
            drew heavily on that work when we wrote our textbook, Public 
            Administration, in 1950. Gaus and Wolcott's work today continues to 
            throw valuable light on how organizations come into existence and 
            grow, often under the influence of technological advances that 
            provide them with the potential for important new activities. The 
            innovations in the Department of Agriculture that their book 
            examined included forest conservation, vaccines to combat animal 
            diseases, and the parity principle to deal with agricultural 
            overproduction during the Great Depression. 
            <P>In fact, Gaus and Wolcott's analysis of the interaction of 
            organizational and technological change resonates strongly with 
            today's interest in the processes and rates of growth of public and 
            business organizations. 

<P><FONT class=sub><B>Research on Complex Organizations</B></FONT> 
<P>This brings me directly to my topic for this evening: the 
            mechanisms that make complex organizations effective instruments for 
            carrying out human purposes. And even closer to the theme of John 
            Gaus's study of the interactions between technological innovation 
            and changes in governmental organization, I should like to ask what 
            kinds of organizational structures facilitate change and innovation. 
            I will talk about both private economic institutions and government. 

<P>Recently, the Russell Sage Foundation sponsored several 
            conferences involving some Nobel Prize winners in economics who have 
            strayed into political science, often either to show how economic 
            analysis could explain political phenomena (i.e., "Public Choice") 
            or to discuss the merits of markets and private enterprises as ways 
            of getting our society's work done (Alt, Levi, and Ostrom 1999). I 
            was invited to participate in the conferences as a Nobel economist, 
            but I treasonably defected to my political science origins in order 
            to defend our political institutions against the imperialism of 
            utility maximization, competitive markets, and privatization. 
            <P>Neoclassical economics created a unified framework for 
            "explaining" virtually all human behavior as produced by an Olympian 
            process of utility maximization that recognizes no limits to the 
            knowledge or thinking powers of the human actors. The neoclassical 
            framework assumed a static equilibrium and, as soon as serious 
            attention began to be paid to dynamic phenomena and uncertainty in 
            large, complex social systems, the structure began to deteriorate, 
            and continues to crumble today. 
<P>Today, economics is in an increasingly chaotic and productive 
            state of disorganization, searching for an alternative picture of 
            economic mechanisms and human rationality--that is, of the genuine 
            bounded rationality of which people are capable. There are 
            theoretical proposals galore; what is still in short supply is 
            detailed empirical research (of kinds that are well-known in 
            political science) to determine how human beings actually go about 
            solving problems and making decisions. 
            <P>I do not intend to reopen the whole range of questions posed by 
            bounded rationality, but will direct my remarks to just one 
            institutional aspect: Why, in a modern society, do we have markets, 
            and why do we have organizations, and what determines the boundary 
            between these two mechanisms for social organization? These 
            questions go to the heart of the roles of our diverse political and 
            administrative institutions, public and private, in contemporary 
            society. 

<P><FONT class=sub><B>Markets as Coordinating Mechanisms</B></FONT> 
<P>If we were to take an extreme libertarian view, both markets and 
            organizations would be unnecessary. For the libertarian, human 
            beings are Leibnitzian monads: hard, elastic little particles that 
            bounce off each other without any other interaction, certainly 
            without either responding to or influencing each others' values. 
            Libertarians can hold to their faith only on the absurd assumption 
            that my exercise of freedom never affects your ability to exercise 
            yours. Quite the opposite: The freedoms and the fates of all six 
            billion of us who occupy this globe are inextricably interwoven. 
            <P>Markets and organizations allow human beings to do together, 
            through interchange of information and the ensuing coordination of 
            activity, things they could not do independently. Coordination 
            simply means organizing activity in such a way as to handle the 
            problems that arise because the behavior of each participant depends 
            in some ways on the behaviors of the others. I hardly need explain 
            why such dependence is often valuable; if you absent-mindedly drive 
            in the right instead of the left lane while visiting Britain, you 
            will find out all too soon. Organizations, some quite large, 
            especially armies, have been with us since the earliest historic 
            times and earlier. Perhaps for that reason, we take them for 
            granted, and they excite in us less wonder than do markets, which 
            developed somewhat later, first locally, then over increasingly long 
            distances. The most peculiar characteristic of markets, Adam Smith's 
            "invisible hand," is their ability to secure coordination without 
            obvious central planning, and without a common interest among their 
            members, for each buyer and seller is supposed to be pursuing 
            independently his or her own private interest. 
            <P>But this invisibility of mutual dependence is deceptive. The 
            usefulness of markets depends on a shared knowledge of the prices 
            and the characteristics of goods that are being traded, the absence 
            of serious third-person effects (so-called "externalities") that are 
            not reflected in prices, and sufficient stability of products and 
            manufacturing practices so that both sellers and buyers can plan 
            their activities rationally and make rational decisions to sell and 
            buy at the prices at which the markets equilibrate. They also depend 
            critically on the safety of transit routes. The effects upon buyers 
            and sellers of agricultural products of prolonged drought, or the 
            effects of closing a strategic strait in a major trade route between 
            India and Europe provide vivid examples of the fragility of markets 
            in the face of various forms of uncertainty, and the social and 
            human distress that can be caused by their malfunctioning. 
            <P>In order to use markets to provide oil for the lamps of China, 
            oil well owners must know that there exists a land, China, where oil 
            will be used in certain volumes at certain prices for at least the 
            proximate future (the relevant time horizon depending on the time 
            required to produce the oil and amortize the investments). And the 
            Chinese buyers will acquire oil lamps only if they believe that oil 
            will be purchasable at a price that makes oil lamps competitive with 
            alternative light sources. Substantial stability of manufacturing, 
            consumption, and trade is essential to markets' working effectively. 
            And, of course, social institutions, and governmental organizations 
            in particular, play an essential role in maintaining (and 
            occasionally destroying) that stability. 
            <P>On another dimension, where there are many competing commodities, 
            similar but not identical, price information may have to be 
            supplemented by product quality information offered by organizations 
            like Consumer Reports so that buyers can compare competing brands, 
            or by governmental regulations to protect them from injurious 
            products. If we wish to understand how complex markets can be, we 
            can turn to building-construction contracts, or contracts for 
            manufacturing large custom-built machinery, and count how many 
            pieces of information have to pass between designers and builders 
            before a contract can be sealed, and how much daily interaction 
            takes place between seller and buyer while the transaction is being 
            completed. Such contracts might almost better be viewed as 
            agreements to form temporary organizations for the duration of 
            particular construction or manufacturing jobs. 
            <P>In summary, markets are, indeed, remarkable coordinating 
            mechanisms in the parsimony of their requirements for information. 
            But they are far less parsimonious than they appear at first blush, 
            for they require a high degree of economic stability and a low level 
            of externalities in order to operate. Moreover, in important classes 
            of market transactions, much product information must flow in the 
            negotiation of the exchange and the subsequent manufacturing 
            process. Adam Smith's invisible hand is often highly visible. 
            Consequently, when the qualifying conditions for stability of 
            markets are not met, as, for example, in wartime, we see a rapid 
            movement toward centralized planning as the preferred coordinating 
            mechanism for many activities. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>From a Market Economy to an Organizational 
            Economy</B></FONT> 
            <P>We are so accustomed to hearing our society described as a market 
            economy that we are often surprised to observe that, since the time 
            of Adam Smith, markets have steadily declined, and business (and 
            governmental) organizations have steadily grown as the principal 
            coordinators of economic activity. In Adam Smith's time, almost the 
            only economic organizations beyond the scale of individual families 
            were agricultural estates directly managed by their owners or 
            through stewards, and relatively small shops owned by guild masters. 
            The putting-out system was a market system, not an organizational 
            system, though one with a special coordinating role for the 
            capitalist who contracted for the successive stages of manufacture 
            of the products--from flax to yarn to cloth to a peasant's blouse. 
            The contractor did not operate as an employer managing a factory. 
            Adam Smith took a dim view of large organizations where management 
            became separated from the direct oversight of the owner. Looking 
            around for examples of such organizations, he found mainly 
            universities like Oxford and Cambridge, which he described as inept, 
            inefficient, and corrupt. (One could claim that Smith anticipated 
            our golden parachutes for salaried executives. Perhaps he was 
            forewarned by the not-infrequent 
            speculations by stewards of the estates of the gentry and 
            aristocracy.) But in spite of Smith's skepticism, organizations have 
            grown until the vast bulk of our economy's activity takes place 
            within the walls of individual large business corporations, not in 
            markets. This growth had already begun to root itself, in the coal 
            mining, iron, ceramics, and textile industries, at the time that 
            Smith was writing his great work, and entered into land and sea 
            transportation a generation or two later. (He foreshadowed it just a <A NAME="back1"></A>
            bit in his tale of the efficiency of specialization in the 
            manufacture of pins.) It was triggered in large measure by 
            technological advance, especially the invention of the steam engine 
            and its applications as a centralized power 
            source for a factory or mine and, later, for a ship or train. <A HREF="h_simon1.htm#1">footnote 1</A> 
            Today, in consequence of these developments, we do not live in a 
            market economy, but in an organization economy, or at most, in an 
            organization/market economy, with a predominance of organizational 
            over market activity. It is ironic that one of the first industries 
            to move toward this new kind of organizational society was 
            transportation, where the railroads enabled an enormous rise of 
            market exchanges over long distances, with correspondingly large 
            factories to produce the goods that were exchanged. Electronics is 
            now completing the comparable transformation of communication. 
            <P>Now, before going on to my next topic, I must issue one caveat. 
            Current developments in electronics, notably the development of the 
            World Wide Web and e-markets, and the enhanced abilities of 
            organizations to manage geographically dispersed activities, provide 
            new opportunities of unknown magnitude for coordination at a 
            distance. Today, we have very little experience with these new 
            developments, both their current forms and their potential. Hence, 
            there is as yet little basis for judging whether markets or 
            organizations will be best able to make use of the new opportunities 
            and whether, as a consequence, we will see a continuation or 
            acceleration of the current trend towards concentration of 
            productive activity within organizations, or will see that trend 
            slowed or even reversed in favor of markets. 
<P><FONT class=sub><B>How 
            Organizations Coordinate</B></FONT> 
                        <P>To understand this growth in organizations, business and 
            governmental, we must understand organizations' ability to 
            coordinate complex activities efficiently, and at far higher levels 
            than markets can attain. As organization theory has long taught us, 
            coordination is not a good but a necessity. Coordination is costly 
            and imperfect, and we wish to introduce no more of it than the 
            structure and intricacy of our goals calls for. Stated a little more 
            positively, organization design focuses on balancing the gains from 
            coordination against its costs. The first step in designing an 
            effective organization is to determine what kinds of 
            interdependencies in its activities will benefit from coordination, 
            and then to minimize the amount of coordination required by 
            partitioning activities in such a way that a much lower rate of 
            interaction, on a more leisurely time scale, is required between 
            subunits at any level than is required within each subunit. This is 
            the familiar division of work. The same issues of balance between 
            the benefits and costs of coordination that guide organizational 
            design also play a major role in defining the boundaries between 
            organizations and markets, which are defined by the decisions of 
            when to make things or perform services within the organization and 
            when to buy them from outside vendors. 
            <P>In any case, the basic reality of the division of work is that 
            high rates of rapid communication are required among people who 
            perform activities that are highly interdependent, much less 
            frequent communication is required among those carrying out 
            activities that are independent, and this distinction should be 
            clearly reflected in organization structure. Systems whose structure 
            reflects these properties are referred to as "nearly decomposable." 
            And a formal mathematical theory exists today that describes them 
            and makes important predictions, as we shall see, about their 
            behavior. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Organizational Identification</B></FONT> 
          
            <P>A second component of organizational design is the special 
            contracts between the organization and its participants: for 
            example, employment contracts with those who work in it, stock and 
            bond ownership contracts with those who contribute capital, and 
            sales contracts with suppliers and customers. A key feature of 
            organizations is the employment contract, which "buys" the 
            employee's efforts during working hours so that they can be applied 
            to the organization's goals. Of course, ordinary economic motives 
            play an important role in securing employee acceptance of 
            employment, but far more is involved. Once installed in the 
            organization, the employee is surrounded by information and 
            influences quite different from those that would surround him or her 
            in another setting, inducing in the employee a strong 
            identification, not only motivational but also cognitive, with the 
            organization and its goals. It is this mechanism of organizational 
            identification that Adam Smith missed when he concluded that large 
            organizations with hired managers could not be efficient. 
            <P>Organizational identification is a powerful motivator, rooted 
            both in people's values and in their need to build a simplified 
            model of the world that focuses upon their particular 
            responsibilities and work environment. It is distinct from the 
            self-interest which, of course, also plays an important part in 
            organizational behavior. 
            <P>It is the organizational identification of members, more than any 
            other of their characteristics, that gives organizations their 
            remarkable power to secure coordinated behavior of large numbers of <A NAME="back2"></A>
            people to accomplish organizational goals, thereby playing a major 
            role during the past two centuries in the rise of modern 
            organizations and in their successful competition with traditional 
            market mechanisms. <A HREF="h_simon1.htm#1">footnote 2</A> Identification has received too little attention 
            in our research on organizations. 
            <P>Organizational identification does not depend on profit motives; 
            it can work within governmental and university organizations as 
            powerfully as within profit-making businesses. Such studies as have 
            been made (not as numerous as one would like) show that, on average, 
            profit-making and governmental organizations that produce the same 
            products, both operating in markets, attain about the same levels of 
            efficiency--the profit motive appears to give no visible competitive 
            edge to private business. So the increasing tendency in recent 
            decades for government agencies to contract out many of their 
            activities evidently is not driven by considerations of 
            efficiency--or, if it is, there is little solid empirical evidence 
            for this preference. 
            <P>What are the implications of this picture for the role of 
            organizations, and especially governmental organizations, in our 
            society? 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Organizational Innovation and Adaptation to 
            Change</B></FONT> 
            <P>The interest in recent years of many sciences in complexity and 
            complex systems has drawn attention to the fact that most of the 
            complex systems seen in the world are nearly decomposable systems. 
            They are arranged in levels, the elements at each lower level being 
            subdivisions of the elements at the level above. Molecules are 
            composed of atoms, atoms of electrons and nuclei, electrons and 
            nuclei of elementary particles. Multicelled organisms are composed 
            of organs, organs of tissues, tissues of cells. 
            <P>Why is this principle of organization so universal? The answer to 
            this question has two parts. The first I have already discussed: 
            Near-decomposability is a means of securing the benefits of 
            coordination while holding down its costs by an appropriate division 
            of labor among subunits. So, if we design complex systems to operate 
            efficiently, we must incorporate near-decomposability in the design. 

            <P>But most of the complex systems we see in nature were not 
            designed; they evolved through the processes of natural selection. 
            In evolution, there is a different, but closely related, reason why 
            near-decomposability prevails. In an environment of evolutionary 
            change and natural selection, nearly decomposable systems will adapt 
            to the changing environment and gain in fitness more rapidly than 
            systems without this property. I can indicate roughly why this is 
            so. 
            <P>If increases in fitness of one organ of an organism do not affect 
            the fitness of other organs (except possibly for adjustment of 
            relative size) and if increases in organ fitness are reflected in 
            the organism's overall efficiency, natural selection will home in 
            rapidly on the favorable changes that occur. Thinking of the 
            evolution of organs as a problem in design, designing each organ to 
            adapt to changing requirements will be much easier if the design of 
            any one organ has little effect on the efficiency of the others; if 
            the heart can be designed without redesigning the lungs, for 
            instance. With a higher degree of dependence, the continued 
            "favorability" of any change in one organ will depend on what 
            changes occur in the other organs at the same time or in the future. 
            There is, then, no simple basis for selecting those changes that 
            will continue to benefit the whole system, creating a dependency 
            among the structures of the separate organs that is highly inimical 
            to change. 
            <P>If complex systems must operate in a constantly changing 
            environment, or in competition with other systems that are changing, 
            they must modify their structures at a corresponding pace. The need 
            for close coordination, even in the presence of strong 
            identification with the organization's goals, places a very heavy 
            burden on a system's capacity to evolve toward greater effectiveness 
            under changed conditions. For although identification reduces the 
            need to police self-interest and to ensure its compatibility with 
            organizational objectives, it also causes excessive influence of 
            existing organizational practices and identifications upon decisions 
            that should be adapting to a changing world. This is the major cause 
            for the difficulty that organizations, even very successful ones, 
            experience in trying to respond to rapidly changing opportunities 
            and challenges, and why they are often outpaced by new organizations 
            that do not carry the same burden of outmoded knowledge and habit. 
            <P>Near-decomposability affects the growth potential of market 
            systems as it does the potential of organizations. Although markets 
            are weakly coordinated systems, permitting a considerable degree of 
            independent change in each component, the change must not be so 
            rapid as to destabilize the expectations of participants that, in 
            stable markets, make large short-term flows of information 
            unnecessary. When markets must compete with organizations as means 
            for securing the benefits of progressive change by rapid adaptation, 
            the former are likely to succeed in this competition only in highly 
            stable environments. 
            <P>In light of these considerations, we might read the history of 
            the past 200 years of industrializing societies as showing that, 
            with the growing advantage that large organizations secured from 
            advanced technology, and our increased skills in designing large 
            organizations that achieve high levels of coordination which 
            maintain a reasonable approximation to near decomposability of their 
            components, we have enlarged greatly the area within which 
            organizations are more effective than markets. This conclusion 
            applies to governmental as well as to business organizations, for 
            both have followed similar paths in the development of their 
            designs. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Social Implications</B></FONT> 
            <P>Let me turn now from these rather abstract and high-level 
            pictures of social systems and the course of their development and 
            ask why it matters. I will focus on two issues: first, the 
            distribution of power in modern society, and, second, the 
            distribution of the social product. I'm afraid that the picture my 
            crystal ball displays is still abstract, but it does refer to 
            matters that are of very practical concern to all of us, 
            individually and collectively. 
<P><FONT class=sub><B>The Distribution 
            of Power</B></FONT> 
            
            <P>Lord Acton said it very well, and I don't think I can say it 
            better: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts 
            absolutely." 
            <P>A central problem in democratic institutions at all times and in 
            all places has been and is to create a broad distribution of power, 
            and to keep that distribution in stable equilibrium. A basic tenet 
            of democratic theory, well supported by historical and other 
            evidence, is that self interest is such a strong motive that no 
            fraction of members of a society can be safely entrusted with the 
            freedom and welfare of others who do not participate in the 
            decision-making processes. 
            <P>During the twentieth century, two massive experiments were 
            carried out, as well as numerous smaller ones, to determine whether 
            major changes in political and economic institutions could produce 
            the "new person" and the new institutions required to realize basic 
            human goals within a highly centralized system of power. It is now 
            widely agreed that the new institutions didn't work well and, 
            especially, that the "new person" didn't appear. The personal 
            motives that emerged in Soviet Russia and in Maoist China appeared 
            to be no less selfish or more virtuous than the motives of people in 
            other parts of the world--in fact, they were discouragingly 
            familiar. 
            <P>Among neoclassical economists, the outcome of these experiments 
            was widely interpreted as a clear vindication of markets being the 
            bulwark of freedom and productivity. The years since the dissolution 
            of the Soviet Union and the complex developments in an 
            industrializing China have shown that matters are not so simple. As 
            to Russia, it has become painfully clear that the introduction of 
            markets without the coincident introduction of socially enforced 
            rules of the game for their operation and the simultaneous creation 
            of viable and effectively managed organizations cannot create a 
            productive economic system. Nor has a stable equilibrium of diffused 
            power been established in Russia. In China, there remain substantial 
            deficiencies in the social enforcement of market rules and, at the 
            same time, continuing governmental interference with normal market 
            operations, as well as equally evident deficiencies in 
            organizational skills and steadfast resistance to the 
            decentralization of power. 
            <P>Nothing that we have seen in these two histories challenges the 
            thesis that diffusion of power requires, in addition to markets, a 
            multiplicity of effective organizations to perform a society's 
            productive and service tasks. In fact, it can well be argued that 
            the most important role markets play in a modern society is to 
            diffuse power by holding organizations, through competition, to the 
            tasks of providing efficiently the things demanded in the markets, 
            thus preventing them from using their resources as power bases for 
            extending their social influence and control by direct influence 
            upon government. A multiplicity of organizations competing 
            vigorously in markets is a strong protection against diversion of 
            resources (by either for-profit or not-for-profit organizations) to 
            political objectives. 
            <P>By the same token, diffusion of power calls for governmental 
            organizations that maintain a reasonable balance between the 
            effectiveness that large business organizations can sometimes 
            provide and an avoidance of concentration of power in a few places. 
            The many experiments with privatization of services that had 
            previously, for good or indifferent reasons, been supplied by public 
            agencies, are beginning now to show us that switching to the 
            market/business-organization system is not a sovereign remedy for 
            all administrative ills. 
            <P>To illustrate what I have in mind, I need merely mention the 
            complex mixture of gains and losses that deregulation of the air 
            transportation industry has brought to its customers (in spite of 
            rosy reports of fare savings). The same can be said of deregulation 
            and privatization of energy distribution, education, and 
            communications, all of which are faced today with perplexing 
            economic and organizational problems. I could add other examples, 
            notably the prison industry, which has not become a magical cure for 
            criminal tendencies as a result of experiments in privatization. 
            <P>Nor can we say that we have solved all of the organizational 
            problems posed by public goods and by such externalities as those 
            associated with preservation of the environment. Experience has 
            indicated that a wide range of essential services can be provided 
            better by government than by any private business arrangement thus 
            far invented, or, as in the case of basic research, will be 
            undersupplied because of public goods aspects, if left to 
            competitive markets. 
            <P>We do not need to reinvent government. Governmental organizations 
            are needed, as they have always been needed, to enforce the rules of 
            the game (including the rules of market contracting), to facilitate 
            coordination of private organizations, and to perform services that 
            are unlikely to be performed effectively by the private sector. The <A NAME="back3"></A>
            legal institutions must be vigorous and independent enough to curb 
            corruptions of the rules of the game by bribery and other illegal 
            activities. And the rules of the game themselves (e.g., rules for 
            political campaign contributions) must themselves not enable 
            influence buying. <A HREF="h_simon1.htm#1">footnote 3</A> In performing these functions, government 
            agencies themselves, of course, become centers of power that help 
            balance the power exerted by the private sector in its own 
            interests. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Distribution of the Social Product: Levels of Employment and 
            Production</B></FONT> 
            <P>There is little consensus in economics today about how to 
            maintain high levels of employment and production, even though, at 
            the moment, we are enjoying these conditions; many economists, when 
            asked why, look toward Heaven and sigh. Among those of my friends 
            and acquaintances who are macroeconomists or specialists on money, I 
            find only one point of general agreement (and even here there is 
            dissent from diehard believers in the gold standard). Most agree 
            that money is neither a solid substance, nor a liquid, nor a gas; it 
            is simply a state of mind. More precisely, money's value is a 
            collection of states of mind of all the people who use it. These 
            states of mind, as history shows, can change in a short time from 
            utmost confidence in a currency to utmost skepticism, and vice 
            versa. On the role of government spending and monetary policy in 
            determining the level of activity, "expert" opinions range from the 
            laissez-faire of rational expectations to Keynesianism and beyond. 
            <P>Having identified this important topic and the disarray of expert 
            views about it, there is only one thing about it that I can say with 
            confidence: Maintaining economic equilibrium cannot be left to the 
            invisible hand of the market, it requires governmental attention. 
            What economists call Say's Law guarantees that the economy can be in 
            equilibrium at any level of activity from 100% employment of workers 
            and capital to zero percent. At both of these levels, and all 
            between, the income from selling goods will just balance the costs 
            of producing them plus the profits of owners. So production produces 
            total incomes that are just sufficient to purchase the marketed 
            product. When markets are not at full employment equilibrium, as 
            they often aren't, neoclassical theory does not explain why, nor 
            what to do about it. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Distribution of the Social Product: 
            Fairness</B></FONT> 
            <P>Just as competitive markets cannot, by themselves, guarantee an 
            adequate distribution of power in a society or full employment, so 
            they do not guarantee that markets will distribute income and wealth 
            in a way that will satisfy our notions of fairness. "Fairness" is, 
            of course, not a question of fact, but of values. What is fair 
            cannot be settled by our science. Hence, I will limit myself to 
            showing the consequences of a particular definition of fairness that 
            has wide currency in our society today: that it is fair that people 
            receive and be allowed to retain what they earn. I am not advocating 
            your adoption of this definition, I'm simply using it to illustrate 
            the complexities of the design of social systems that take the 
            question of fairness into account. 
            <P>Let me pose a simple question. Consider the income that you or 
            your family now earn as members of American society (which most of 
            you are) and compare it with the income that you would expect to 
            earn if you were equally hardworking members of Chinese or Indian 
            society, or the society of any other Third World nation. I expect 
            that for most of you, the difference between the two incomes is one 
            or more orders of magnitude, at least 10 to 1 and perhaps even more 
            than 100 to 1. 
            <P>Now, I would like you to consider the causes for the gap between 
            the 10 and the 1 or the 100 and the 1. How much of it do you wish to 
            attribute to your superior energy, motivation, and application of 
            effort as compared with your Third World counterparts? And how much 
            do you wish to attribute to your good luck or good judgment in being 
            born in, or joining, the highly productive and democratic American 
            society? 
            <P>If we are very generous with ourselves, I suppose we might claim 
            that we "earned" as much as one fifth of it. The rest is the 
            patrimony associated with being a member of an enormously productive 
            social system, which has accumulated a vast store of physical 
            capital, and an even larger store of intellectual capital--including 
            knowledge, skills, and organizational know-how held by all of us--so 
            that interaction with our equally talented fellow citizens rubs off 
            on us both much of this knowledge and this generous allotment of 
            unearned income. Again, I have no specific proposal for allocating 
            the "unearned" income of an affluent society. That, of course, is 
            one of the important things we will be voting on in November. 
            Clearly, the allocation of income in a society is a matter of values 
            to be decided by political processes. 
            <P>What I wish to emphasize is simply that public attitudes about 
            the fair allocation of income are necessarily and justifiably a 
            major factor in determining the scope and nature of public 
            organizations in the society. There is no way in which the proper 
            allocation of the social product can be left solely to the market in 
            a private-organization/market/public-organization society, or solely 
            to considerations of productive efficiency. Society is demonstrably 
            not a collection of Leibnitzian monads. Much more flows between the 
            members of a society, in the form of exchange of information and 
            cooperation, than the simple interchange of momentum by impact. 
            Market equilibria that are Pareto efficient will often be inferior 
            to other equilibria, Pareto efficient or not, when criteria of 
            fairness are applied. 
            <P><FONT class=sub><B>Conclusion</B></FONT> 
            <P>It is not too fanciful to think of writing a history of human 
            civilization in terms of progress in the means of human cooperation, 
            that is, of organization. In that history, hierarchical and nearly 
            decomposable systems would play a central role. Almost from the 
            beginning, the division of work into component tasks and the 
            assembly of the components into a hierarchy were discovered to be 
            powerful means for achieving efficient coordination of effort. In a 
            later period, markets entered as a means of coordinating certain 
            kinds of transactions that required very limited communication, and 
            therefore can take place over long distances. Then, long before the 
            Christian era, nation states and empires emerged that show there is 
            almost no upper limit to the sizes to which organizations can 
            aspire. 
            <P>The system, after more than a millennium and a half, entered a 
            new stage when the social store of knowledge and innovation in 
            technologies begin to accelerate, with markets again at first 
            playing a central role in enabling these developments. Gradually, 
            increases in the demands for, and in the advantages of, more 
            coordination in economic activity, together with the accumulation of 
            skills of organizing, brought into existence ever-larger 
            corporations that begin to emulate in size the administrative 
            organizations of the nation-states--and we were launched into our 
            modern world. 
            <P>Both private and public organizations have played essential roles 
            in these modern developments, complementing each others' functions, 
            learning from each other, and, at the same time, competing for power 
            to steer and manage the systems that have emerged. That process has 
            not reached its end, and political science and economics must 
            continue their mutual education, with each discipline learning from 
            the other. 
            <P>The education must be symmetric. Its goal is not to convert 
            political science into a theory of the "public choices" of a 
            mythical, utility-maximizing "economic person." Its goal is to 
            understand how human behavior molds and is molded by the complex 
            structures it employs to secure the coordination needed to 
            accomplish most of its goals, and how this can be accomplished while 
            preserving the wide dispersion of power that is consistent with 
            democratic institutions.
