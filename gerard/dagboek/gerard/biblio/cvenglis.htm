<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I was born in 1929 in Venlo in The Netherlands.
After WW II I have been hitchhiking all over Europe and I have taken a
keen interest in European and inter-cultural affairs, which continues up
to the present time. I studied mathematics and engineering. I have&nbsp;
been a European businessman for two Dutch multinationals, travelling throughout
Europe for many years. I had my&nbsp; own consulting business for some
time. Later I became professor at the Faculty of Industrial Design of the
University of Technology at Delft University. During that time I was Dean
of Faculty and chaired several years the Permanent Committee for Education.
During this period, I taught courses in Paris, among others, at the
<I>Ponts
&amp; Chauss&eacute;es.</I> Besides this, I had various activities in socio-cultural
fields: I ran a workshop on Elementary Theatre; developing specific methods
for young (and older) people preferring to be self-employed and facilitated
many workshops on 'going solo'. I further took part in various initiatives
in the context of 'alternative' learning/teaching outside the schooling
system,&nbsp; mainly for adults. For several years, I was president of
Memoles, a private foundation for the support of small enterprises aiming
at more respectful relationships with mankind in its natural form.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The methods and theories in my consulting
projects, for one part, stemmed from the regular business world and from
the 'alternative' thinking on the other. In that sense, these were 'transcultural'
projects: To create acceptance for the thinking and the methods of one
in relation to the other. One of the larger projects of this kind was the
transfer to Eastern Europe, in 1991, of the workshops on 'going solo' --and
all its know-how-- for final year students, and the unemployed, who were
considering self-employment. As planned, these workshops proliferated to
a great extent.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After my retirement in 1994, I sold my&nbsp;
house in Eindhoven and left The Netherlands for good. Since then, I have
been travelling light, looking only for regions with the purest air and
highest temperatures. That is to say: A Mediterranean summer in the South
of France, and the Canarian Isles for the rest of the time. Nevertheless,
I prefer travelling to Chile for a real warm Mediterranean summer during
our wintertime.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I have taken a keen interest in <I>El
Mundo Espa&ntilde;ol</I>. With all my knowledge, it still surprises my
northern european eyes for its profound cultural differences. More than
once, my anti authoritarian soul is offended by its shameless authoritarianism.
I'm writing about my street observations in Spanish, in French and in Dutch.</FONT></TD>
