<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">I found this story several years ago on a discussion list about food.
I don't have any idea who is Pritikin.
<BR>Penny is apparantly the person who put it on the list. G&eacute;rard</CENTER>

<TD BGCOLOR="#FFCC33"><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">I've always liked this
story; hope some of y'all might, as well. It's from Robert Pritikin, son
of Nathan Pritikin. --Penny&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">One of my father's favorite analogies had
to do with arsenic. Imagine a society, he'd say, where people were crazy
about arsenic--they loved the way it tasted, and it went with just about
every food. They sprinkled it on cereal, stirred it into hot drinks, cooked
it into meat, vegetables, bread, desserts. Soon you couldn't buy a food
that wasn't doused with arsenic: It was an unbeatable flavor-enhancer and
no one could imagine food without it.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Then people started to get sick. Some people's
hair fell out, others lost their teeth, others got nauseated and dizzy
or suffered excruciating headaches. Some people even died, right in the
middle of a golf game or after lunch! What was going on? Was there any
common link in all these different illnesses?&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Doctors, nutritionists, and other experts
scrambled around trying to cure what seemed to be a growing number of baffling
diseases. Some even wondered if it could be arsenic--it was in everything,
wasn't it? But no, it couldn't be. Look at all the people who ate just
as much arsenic as everyone else--and seemed to be fine!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">So the Hair Association funded research
into new hair-loss treatments and better hair transplants. The Tooth Association
came up with "new, improved" false teeth and dental aids. Pharmaceutical
companies pushed a wide range of drugs to combat nausea, dizziness, and
headaches. Some of these preparations did what they claimed to do--but
most had side effects that were as bad as the symptoms they were designed
to alleviate! And none of them worked on every disease. You took one drug
to combat this symptom, and another--or several--appeared in its place.
If you took more than one drug at a time they often counteracted each other,
or led to completely new symptoms--everything from diarrhea to impotence!&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Then came some truly terrible news: Research
seemed to indicate that a common link in some of these illnesses *might*,
after all, be excess arsenic. But people couldn't do without arsenic--they
loved it too much! It was what made food *good*.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">Drug companies, dietitians, and medical
specialists fell over themselves trying to come up with solutions. "Experts"
told television audiences they could "get all of the taste of arsenic and
none of the harm with Product X." "Health foods" boasted things like "23
percent less arsenic per serving! "Best-selling books (_Who Says You Can't
Eat Arsenic?_ ran one popular title) vied in a market hungry for a quick
fix--and for the taste of arsenic. In the medical establishment, the gears
ground slowly: "Nothing," they reported, was "quite conclusive yet."&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">And still people got sick, and died. Finally,
someone who'd been following all this because he was suffering so badly
himself, and was frustrated because no medication seemed to help him, got
an idea: "What would happen if I just *stopped* eating arsenic?" So that's
exactly what he did. And what happened was remarkable--even miraculous.
His symptoms disappeared. All those cures, promises, and quick fixes, all
those megadoses of vitamins and minerals, all the drugs and all the medicines--
suddenly he didn't need any of them. And there was a dividend: Food *didn't*
need arsenic to taste good! In fact, once he stopped adding arsenic to
his food, he liked it better than when it was doused with the stuff.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">My father, Nathan Pritikin, liked this
story because it was, in effect, his own story. His poison wasn't arsenic,
of course. His--and our--poison (which he deduced from evidence so clear
that it seems amazing today that nobody else was willing to draw the same
conclusions from it) was excess fat, cholesterol, and salt--and foods so
overprocessed that they're virtually devoid of nutrition.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">....the central message (of Pritikin's
program is): If you don't want to get poisoned, don't eat poison.&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
