<P><A name=Twis></A><STRONG>Francis Morphet Twisleton (1873–1917)</A></STRONG> 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3T47)

<BR>landed at Gallipoli on 20 May 1915. 
He wrote a number of private letters which provide an insight into the reality 
of trench warfare. Soon he adjusted to the <STRONG>'very funny sort of life one 
leads, we burrow like rabbits and live more or less underground and do most of 
our work at night'</STRONG>. 
<BR>Twisleton took part in the bloody assaults on Bauchop's Hill and Hill 60 
during August 1915. In his vivid account of the second of these actions he 
described the roar of battle as so overpowering that he felt as though he 
<STRONG>'was being driven into the ground by being hit on the head'</STRONG>. 
Twisleton was slightly wounded during the initial charge, and took the 
opportunity afforded by a lull in the fighting to dig small pieces of shrapnel 
out of his leg with his pocket-knife. In the aftermath of the battle for Hill 60 
he commanded a post where the stench was appalling because it was partly 
constructed out of the bodies of Turkish soldiers. Later he wrote, <STRONG>'I 
felt as though I could scrape the smell of dead men out of my mouth and throat 
and stomach in chunks.'</STRONG> 
<BR>At the beginning of September 1915 Twisleton was evacuated from Gallipoli 
with severe dysentery; he did not return. For his bravery and initiative during 
the campaign he was awarded the Military Cross and mentioned in dispatches. 

<P><A name=TeWai></A>
<P><STRONG>Henare Wepiha Te Wainohu&nbsp; (1882–1920)</STRONG> 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3T23)
<BR>was a chaplain during the 
Gallipoli campaign. At first there was official opposition to sending Maori 
troops into battle, and after months of training in Egypt and garrison duty at 
Malta they were becoming restless. Eventually the Maori Contingent was sent to 
reinforce the New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, arriving in July 1915. On 6 
August they were sent into battle beside their Pakeha comrades at Sari Bair. On 
the eve of the battle Te Wainohu preached a sermon that was later much quoted 
and which formed the basis for a proverb. As well as exhorting the soldiers to 
be fearless in battle and not to turn their backs on the enemy, he reminded them 
of their duty to uphold the warrior tradition of the Maori: <STRONG>'remember 
you have the <I>mana</I>, the honour and the good name of the Maori people in 
your keeping this night'</STRONG>. This appeal, in particular, gave courage to 
the soldiers.&nbsp; 
<BR>Henare Te Wainohu risked his life for others on many occasions at Gallipoli. 
In the company of the medical officer, Major Peter Buck, he carried out the 
wounded, distributed water, and comforted the dying - often under fire. He was 
wounded in the back in September 1915. After the evacuation of Gallipoli, Te 
Wainohu accompanied the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion, in which the contingent 
was now integrated, to France. 

<P><A name=Rout></A><STRONG>Ettie Annie Rout (1877–1936)</STRONG>
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3R31)
<BR>In July 1915, during the Gallipoli 
campaign, Ettie Rout set up the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood and invited 
women between the ages of 30 and 50 to go to Egypt to care for New Zealand 
soldiers. In spite of government opposition, she sent the first batch of 12 
volunteers to Cairo that October. 
<BR>Ettie Rout arrived in Egypt in February 1916, and immediately noticed the 
soldiers' high venereal disease rate. She saw this as a medical not a moral 
problem, one which should be approached like any other disease –— with all 
available preventive measures. She recommended the issue of prophylactic kits 
and the establishment of inspected brothels, and tried to persuade the New 
Zealand Medical Corps officers to this view, with no success. 
<BR>Believing that the army was not looking after the men well enough, she opened 
the Tel El Kebir Soldiers' Club and later a canteen at El Qantara, to provide 
better rest and recreation facilities and better food. For this work she was 
mentioned in dispatches and in the Australian official war history.&nbsp;
<BR>In June 1917 the venereal disease problem was still very bad so she went to 
London to push the New Zealand Medical Corps into adopting prophylactic 
measures. She combined the work of several researchers to produce her own 
prophylactic kit, containing calomel ointment, condoms and Condy's crystals 
(potassium permanganate). She sold these at the New Zealand Medical Soldiers 
Club, which she set up at Hornchurch near the New Zealand Convalescent Hospital. 
<BR>At the end of 1917 the NZEF adopted her kit for free and compulsory 
distribution to soldiers going on leave. Ettie Rout received no credit for her 
role in the kit's development and adoption, and for the duration of the war the 
cabinet banned her from New Zealand newspapers under the War Regulations. 
Mention of her brought a possible £100 fine after one of her letters, suggesting 
kits and hygienic brothels, had been published in the <I>New Zealand Times</I>. 
Ironically, this letter had been instrumental in the decision of the defence 
minister, James Allen, to approve kit issue. Others, particularly women's 
groups, accused her of trying to make 'vice' safe. Lady Stout led a deputation 
of women to ask the prime minister, William Massey, to put an end to Rout's 
Hornchurch club.

<P><A name=Brooke></A>
<P><STRONG>Evelyn Gertrude Brooke 1879-1962</STRONG> 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3B51)
<BR>Evelyn Brooke was appointed matron on the 
hospital ship <I>Maheno</I> which embarked for Turkey in July 1915. As a 
hospital ship matron she was responsible for all nursing arrangements. Much of 
the work was carried out by male orderlies, whom she had to train, but who were 
under the command of a non-commissioned officer (the wardmaster). It was thus 
necessary for everyone to be tactful and generous, but, from the first, disputes 
arose over rank. Nurses were commissioned officers but many male officers 
refused to recognise this and the women were <STRONG>'subjected to a great deal 
of unpleasantness'</STRONG>. 
<BR>Seasickness devastated many of Brooke's staff, and the horrors of war could 
not be avoided: during August and September 1915 the <I>Maheno</I> made five 
visits to Anzac Cove at Gallipoli. In extreme heat, while bullets raked the 
decks, the nurses worked with the <STRONG>'poor, torn, mangled fellows'</STRONG> 
amid the <STRONG>'horrible sickly odour' </STRONG>of dysentry, disease and 
decay.&nbsp; 
<BR>Brooke returned to New Zealand in January 1916 to be matron of the military 
hospital at Trentham.&nbsp; 

<P><A name=Silva></A>
<P><STRONG>Paul Thomas Silva (1897–1974)</STRONG>. 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=4S25)

<BR>In December 1914 Paul Silva enlisted as a 
private in the Auckland Battalion, New Zealand Infantry Brigade. He arrived in 
Egypt in March 1915 and on 25 April took part in the Gallipoli landings. Three 
weeks later he was shot in the face and spent three days unconscious on a 
hospital ship. He received severe injuries to his jaw and his left eye, which 
was removed before he regained consciousness. He spent most of the remainder of 
the year recuperating in Maltese hospitals. He later became a competitive wood 
chopper. 

<P><A name=Begg></A>
<P><STRONG>Charles Mackie Begg (1879–1919)</STRONG>
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3B23)
<BR>On 17 April 1915 Charles Begg, 
a qualified doctor and Field Ambulance superviser, embarked for Gallipoli from 
Alexandria. When the Anzacs landed on 25 April casualties were unexpectedly 
heavy. Begg sent his bearer sections ashore while his surgical teams provided 
treatment on various ships. These were quickly filled by casualties ferried on 
barges and many did not get the surgery they needed. On 28 April Begg dug in a 
dressing station on the beach. Surgery began immediately and continued through 
incessant shelling and small-arms fire until 27 June, when a Turkish shell 
destroyed the station and wounded Begg. Nevertheless, he took his depleted unit 
along the beach to start up again under Walker's Ridge. Between 25 April and 5 
August the dressing station treated over 15,000 wounded Anzacs. 
<BR>On 7 August 1915 the New Zealanders suffered grievous losses during their 
attack on Chunuk Bair, and the under-staffed Ambulances could not handle the 
casualties. On 9 August Colonel Neville Manders, assistant director of medical 
services of the New Zealand and Australian division, was shot and Begg took his 
place. By this time there was a breakdown in the collection and evacuation of 
the wounded, and hundreds were lying unprotected on the beach. When Begg made a 
direct approach to Generals Alexander Godley and F. C. Shaw, infantry units 
arrived to help the bearers and the navy resumed its barge transport. By 13 
August the beach had been cleared. A few days later Begg was taken to a hospital 
ship for treatment of para-typhoid fever and was transported to the No 1 General 
Hospital, Camberwell, England. After a short convalescence, returned to 
Gallipoli at the beginning of November. As winter approached, he helped to plan 
the successful withdrawal of troops from the peninsula. General I. S. M. 
Hamilton mentioned Begg in dispatches on 26 August 1915, and he was appointed a 
CMG on 8 November 1915. 

<P><A name=Godl></A>
<P><STRONG>Alexander John Godley (1867–1957)</STRONG> 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3G12)
<BR>On 25 April 1915 the New Zealand and 
Australian Division was landed on the Gallipoli peninsula. Major General Godley 
and his troops were harshly tested in this campaign. If the men came out with a 
better reputation than Godley, it was at least partly because their courage was 
supplemented by his training. Godley himself, however, appears not to have 
allowed for the steep, rugged ground and the need to reconnoitre it closely, the 
very poor communications, the losses of some of his most competent officers, and 
the debility of the troops after time spent on the peninsula. Neither should 
Godley later have claimed the troops were adequately fed; the food was 
appalling. 
<BR>The New Zealand minister of defence, James Allen, writing to Major General 
Andrew Russell, said it would have been better if somebody else had been placed 
in command once Godley had completed his training programme. But in 1914–15 the 
alternative, for a then unknown division, would probably&nbsp; have been a 
retired British general less competent administratively and even less in touch 
operationally. Early in the war neither Andrew Russell nor Edward Chaytor would 
have been regarded as qualified for divisional command. Moreover, when questions 
were raised in Parliament and elsewhere about Godley and he offered to resign, 
Allen publicly supported him. 
<BR>After the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, the New Zealand Division was 
sent to France in 1916 as part of Lieutenant General Birdwood's I ANZAC Corps. 
Godley, who had been promoted to lieutenant general in November 1915, was in 
command of II ANZAC Corps, to which the New Zealand Division was transferred on 
October 1916, after serving in the battle of the Somme. 

<P><A name=Malone></A>
<P><STRONG>William George Malone (1859–1915)</STRONG> 
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3M40)
<BR>The Wellington battalion, which Malone commanded, landed on the Gallipoli 
peninsula on 25 April. Malone immediately began to impose order. By example, 
determination and drive he transformed weak defences held by frightened men into 
ordered garrisons which dominated their Turkish opponents. He consolidated and 
secured the ANZAC Corps perimeter whenever it was threatened. The losses 
suffered at Helles on 8 May confirmed for him that <STRONG>'this is the day of 
digging and machine guns and that prepared positions cannot be rushed'</STRONG>. 
As post commander at Courtney's Post and Quinn's Post between June and August he 
put this into practice by consolidating a precarious position at Quinn's Post, 
where an advance of 20 metres by the Turks would have forced the evacuation of 
the ANZAC Corps. 
<BR>Malone fought his superiors for building material and for basic comforts for 
his men as fiercely as he fought the Turks. His diaries [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/Gallery/Anzac/MaloneDi.htm] chart 
a growing disenchantment with impractical British regular officers, and a 
growing love for his men. Malone would not take 'no' for an answer, and this led 
to a clash of wills between him and his New Zealand Infantry Brigade commander, 
Colonel F. E. Johnston, and his staff. Malone survived with the support of 
Johnston's superiors, Major General Sir A.J. Godley, commander of the New 
Zealand and Australian Division, and Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, 
commanding the ANZAC Corps. 
<BR>Malone was killed during the fight for Chunuk Bair on 8 August 1915.

<BR><A name=Bollinger></A>
<P><B>George Wallace Bollinger (1890–1917)</B>
<BR>(full biography: http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3B39)
<BR>The diary [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/Gallery/Anzac/BollDi.htm] 
which Bollinger kept from the time he left Wellington on 16 October 1914 
documents superbly the experiences and shifting attitudes of a New Zealand 
soldier during the Gallipoli campaign. At first there is unqualified enthusiasm 
for battle, expressed in his desire for a 'brush-up' with the 'niggers' of Cairo 
and his excitement at departing for the Dardanelles. But when he lands on the 
Gallipoli peninsula in the early morning of 26 April 1915, and faces the smells 
and the flies and the constant presence of death on a Turkish hillside, 
Bollinger's attitude changes. He is openly joyful to be relieved from the 
trenches at Cape Helles in early May, and comments that the heroic images of war 
in the New Zealand newspapers serve to conceal the ghastly reality. When he 
returns to the peninsula in mid August, after a month recovering from gastritis 
in Egypt, he is 'very quiet', and by the time he is evacuated to Moúdhros Bay on 
15 September he has become bitter about mismanagement and the betrayal of his 
mates' self-sacrifice. 
<BR>Back in New Zealand the following year, Bollinger, whose father was Bavarian, 
was investigated by the Defence Department following complaints from anti-German 
campaigners.
