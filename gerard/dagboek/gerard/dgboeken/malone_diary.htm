<P><STRONG>Sunday 25th April</STRONG> A lovely calm spring morning, We left Port 
Mudros, Lemnos, at 6.10 am [for] Gaba Tepe, Peninsula of Gallipoli with other 
Transports, having been preceded by Advance Landing Scouts [of the] Australian 
Division. We towed two barges in which to land troops and horse. A lovely calm 
and in nature a peaceful day. But the huge 15 inch guns of the <I>Queen 
Elizabeth</I> could be heard at sixty miles distance bombarding forts etc at 
Cape Helles and Sedd El Bahr where the 29th British Division was landing. As we 
got in we could see the action. <B>Quite a number of Men-of-War, British, French 
and Russian blazing away. Transports steaming in close to the shore and landing 
troops in boats and barges. The shells were bursting all along the Turkish 
position which seemed strongly held. </B>We did not steam nearer than about six 
miles but withglasses could see what a great and furious fight was going on. The 
French Division was making a feint on the coast of Asia Minor so as to keep 
troops there. We sailed on Northwards and got near Gaba Tepe which is some ten 
miles north of Cape Helles; found that our Army was landing at a bay some two 
miles North East of Gaba Tepe. It had commenced landing at 3.30 am and had been 
most gallantly, nay recklessly, carried out. The men-of-war, <I>Majestic, 
Triumph Queen, Inflexible</I> and others were firing furiously. Transports were 
landing troops. 
<P>The Australians had carried the heights surrounding the Bay but instead of 
being content with that and then digging in hard and fast had scally-wagged for 
miles into the interior, some three or four miles, got scattered and so became a 
prey to the Turks who had been surprised in the first place and had (it is said) 
only some 500 defending troops at our landing place. Their troops encamped at 
Bijuk Anafarta and Koja Dere were brought against the scattered Australians and 
slaughtered them. As the New Zealanders landed they were rushed up to the 
heights, mixed up higgledy-piggledy among themselves and with Australians with 
the result, in the case of my men anyhow (in my opinion), in serious avoidable 
loss. 
<P>At 4.30 pm my first troops went ashore … I went with this consignment. When 
we got within about one mile from the shore we got into our ship's boats and 
rowed ashore. The Turks welcomed us with shrapnel and sprayed up the sea all 
about us, but very few of us got hit. The beach was crowded with all sorts of 
beings, men, mules, donkeys, horses, ammunition supplies, naval beach parties. 
In getting out of the boats many men got a salt water bath all over. They had 
full packs, 200 rounds of ammunition, three days food, etc and so easily slipped 
and fell. <B>There didn't seem much organisation on the shore, in fact it was 
disorganisation. We evidently haven't got a Kitchener about.</B> On paper it was 
all right but in practice no good. Still Britishers always muddle thro' somehow 
or another. The heads, like Generals Birdwood and Godley <I>plan</I> all right, 
but the executive officers in the main, are no good. Have no idea of order, 
method, etc. They, as I put it, "hand up everyone on the ground". The whole Army 
does … 
<P>I struck Generals Birdwood and Godley and they were very disappointed when 
they found my Battalion (less half a Company) were still on the sea. The Naval 
people for some unknown reason knocked off disembarkation. I got the General to 
wireless to the ships to carry one and about midnight the remaining one and a 
half Companies in <I>Itonus</I> got ashore and were sent to hold a ridge just 
above the beach. They had no tools as all our Battalion tools were on the 
<I>Achaia</I> with the other half Battalion! I had asked to get half of them at 
Port Mudros so that when we landed we would be independent but it was not 
allowed by our brigadier. However I got some of my Headquarters detail to go 
along the beach and collect all the tools they could. They got quite a number 
and then I sent them up to the ridge to enable the men to dig in. 
<P>I had rather an amusing incident. I was going along the beach close to the 
cliffs where there were crowds of men sleeping, finding out who they were so as 
to help reorganisation of units. Quoth I to one group: "Who are you fellows?" Lo 
and behold they were Generals Birdwood, Godley and Bridges and their staff. And 
lo and behold there were quite a number of picks and shovels in their quarters. 
I soon got all the tools and sent them up to my men. By daylight Hart and the 
Second Company off <I>Achaia</I> landed. We were ordered into Reserve alongside 
Army Headquarters as an Army Reserve. We placed ourselves up a Gully, narrow and 
steep, full of scrub, and remained there until 4.00 pm of the next day when we 
were ordered to go up the gully on to the Plateau and report to General Walker, 
who was our acting Brigadier, Colonel F E Johnston being ill with gastric 
influenza. We had an awful climb. I found General Walker and reported but he 
didn't know what to do with us but in the end put us in reserve. 
<P>All this time the big ships' guns were booming away. Also quick firing 
howitzers, mountain guns and rifles. Endless fighting. Shrapnel bursting on and 
close to the beach, boats and barges going to and from the ships and beach 
landing all sorts of men and things. In the night of Sunday I know there were 
some questions among the Generals of our having to re-embark. Personally I could 
see nothing to require it. As General Walker's Plateau was congested with men 
without my Battalion, I asked, and obtained, leave to take them below the crest. 
We got settled down into dugouts and then got an Army Order to go back into our 
original reserve position. This from General Birdwood himself. <B>We had been up 
the hill and now down again. Still we are all philosophers now.</B> 
<P>Next morning, Tuesday the 27th, we were sent up another gully in which two 
Howitzers were placed and then to a place on the beach North of Divisional 
Headquarters and then told to draw two days rations and march North along the 
beach to where a big ridge came down from the high country surrounding the Bay. 
Duly, away we went. Arrived at the foot of the ridge, found General Walker, and 
heard a roar for reinforcements coming down the hill. Irresponsible men. 
Australian privates, passing the word for 'Reinforcements at the double!!' 
General Walker told us at once to send a Company up, packs to be left at the 
bottom. In enquired what they were to do? Where to go? I was told they would be 
met at the top and put right. So away they went. No soon gone than more yells of 
the same sort from the Australians. Another Company of men ordered to follow the 
first one. The Companies were (first) Wellington West Coast, (second) Hawkes 
Bay. Some 450 of the best soldier men in the world. <B>They were being sent to 
chaos and slaughter, nay murder.</B> 
<P>I then brought up the remaining one and half Companies to about half way, 
which the Australian Brigadier told me to hold in Reserve. On doing this, more 
yells for reinforcements. I took on myself to stop the yelling and say no more 
reinforcements should go up in that irresponsible way. I went up myself to find 
out the position. A long climb along and up a ridge. I struck a sort of natural 
fort along it, entrenched and occupied by about forty Australians and two 
machine guns, one Major, a fat chap. I asked him what he was doing there sending 
down yells for reinforcements. He said he was passing the yells on. I asked him 
why he did not go himself and take his men with him. He said he had orders to 
stay. I went on, passing a score of Australian men wounded, lying all along the 
track. Finally I got to a Colonel Braund who said he was in command of the show. 
I asked for some explanation of the position and why he had left his own men 
down the ridge and called for reinforcements from the New Zealanders. <B>He 
didn't know and knew nothing. Had no defensive position, no plan, nothing but a 
murderous notion that the only thing to do was to plunge troops out of the neck 
of the ridge into the jungle beyond. </B>The Turks, of whom very few were seen 
by any of my officers, were lying down, shooting down all the bits of track that 
led from the ridge outwards; having range marks fixed, and dropping our men 
wholesale. Majors Young and Cunningham grasped the situation soon and told who 
they could to dig in. This was begun, but Colonel Braund came along and ordered 
the Platoon Commanders to go on and plunge into the jungle further and further. 
On their protesting he claimed as Senior Officer, their obedience to his orders, 
and so, on and on they went and got slaughtered … I made Colonel Braund send 
back and take all the Australians forward and to shift his Headquarters forward. 
I then went back to Brigade Headquarters to report and was told to bring up my 
remaining one and a half Companies to the fort. After getting them up I started 
to go forward again up the track to get a grip of things but was met by a lot of 
Australians tearing down the track yelling 'Fix bayonets, the Turks are coming.' 
I whipped back to the fort and put two machine guns on front slope with a line 
of best shots of the Ruahine [Company] and sorted the other men out in readiness 
to hold back the Turks. I really believed we were in for a solid thing and told 
the men we would have to stick it out at all costs. I then went forward and 
found that the panic, for such it was, had been stopped, thanks mainly to Major 
Hart, who had been sent on by me ahead of the Reserve to get a hand of things … 
He, like the good chap he is, steadied … the men … 
<P>By now wounded men by the score were being brought back and laid along the 
track, all sorts of wounds. The stretcher bearers couldn't cope with the number 
and soon there were no stretchers. I got an immediate demand from Colonel Braund 
for more reinforcements but sent him a firm refusal. He then said as I would not 
send him up more reinforcements he would have to retire to his first position. I 
told him he never ought to have left it … 
<P>Colonel Braund then came to see me and, on my asking why he had been doing as 
he had, said that the truth was he feared that if he didn't go on, his men would 
run away. I said <I>that</I> was no reason to sacrifice <I>my</I> men. I went 
and reported to General Walker and asked that the whole of the Australians be 
withdrawn as soon as possible. He came back with me to the position. <B>We 
struck lots of Australians who hadn't moved. I ordered them up and drove them 
ahead, pelting the leading ones on the track when they stopped with stones and 
putting my toe into the rear ones.</B> 
<P>By this time wounded men were being brought back in scores (<B>my Battalion's 
casualties out of two and a half Companies, say 450 men, were about 45 killed 
and 150 wounded in about first hour of action</B>) and left on track, no 
stretchers being available. They were all very brave. No cries or even groans. 
One man kept say 'Oh Daddy', 'Oh Daddy' in a low voice. Many greeted me 
cheerfully 'Well Colonel I've got it.' Many smiled. My men are wonderful. The 
world never saw better men or braver, I am sure. After the frightful murderous 
slaughter bungled by Colonel Braund of the Australians they hurry on, fired at 
from all quarters, yet unable in the jungle to see many of their enemy [and] dug 
themselves in. 
<P>I went up with Hart and we divided up the ground held - sent up picks and 
shovels and the night was passed by all hands dig dig digging. Turks firing from 
a distance all the night with shrapnel, machine guns and rifle. Hart, poor chap, 
directing operations got shot in the leg. Flesh wound only I am glad to say. He 
will be back in about a fortnight. He was shot by a Turk within a few yards. The 
Turks threw hand grenades at us through the night.
